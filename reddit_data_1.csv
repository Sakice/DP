A lot of the parents on RedNote are crazy, it has became a user stereotype for the app in China.. I work in the children's book industry, and one of my Chinese collaborators showed me once that a mom on RedNote is complaining about a picture book for pre-schoolers showing little girls wearing two pieced bath suits. The book is about going on a beach vacation with the family. The mom's complaint was that the bathing suit looks like bikini and kids should not be wearing bikinis for it is basically lingerie. 

Another RedNote parent comment I saw was about a picture book on pregnancy, the commenter was furious about the mom wearing jewelries and makeup. She claimed women in pregnancy wearing accessories and makeups are irresponsible to the baby's health. She even filed complains to the government to have the picture book removed from all platform for false info."

Where it's illustrated how the ‘knee’ of most animals is in fact the ankle, because they walk on the toes.

And generally it's fun to see how vast majority of vertebrates have the same structure of the skeleton. Like, the number of cervical vertebras is the same for most of them, including the giraffe. (Afaik birds and snakes can have a radically different number.)"

Edit: this is looking to be my most upvoted comment, thanks lmao. Its a fairly easy book to find, i just -duckduckgoed- ""human anatomy compared to horse illustrated Japanese"" found the author name and searched that. The version shown in op is likely a Chinese translation (hence red book and only kanji no kana) but I knew from old encounters that the original book was japanese

I searched his name on Amazon and they have it. I thought it was strange because it’s a Japanese guy’s name but the writing is Chinese. It’s titled “Exchanging bodies with animals - Chinese version”

Even though the original Japanese title translates to “A turtle’s shell is abara bone: An anatomical picture book of things that move”

— I didn’t know what “abara bone” was but I looked it up and it means “ribs”"

My country is violent? Well ya.... Some city are dangerous. But we dont have school shooting every week.
We have police brutality, ya. The same way US has police brutality too. Maybe because both of us had a shameful slavery past.

But..... Seriously that US people think that owning a car is making them better than others? This is kinda pathetic.

It's like the girl in the video. US people believe they live in paradise, but the reality is just they live worse than most of people in the world. A minority of rich people live well. In Brasil we have public health system (or health care.... Whatever). It's not perfect, but at least we have that. But the woman thinks owning a mediocre car is the top level."

The west doesn't need to ""teach"" them about rebelling and blablabla.

Their (China) history is cyclical (but spiraling above) anyway (See Mandate of Heaven).

It's already a self-regulating one, the current holder of that is the CPC, and for a really long time it'll stay that way.

Such a strange thing that the west probably thought that Chinese are obedient drones."

So much so that Subaru, a brand not known for its reliability, actually climbed the ranks to #1 in 2024.

Also I'm not sure about your country but when I look at Hondas that are only a few years old, many of them already have clearcoat failure. I think a lot of Japanese brands that were good back in the 2010s are now currently experiencing late-stage capitalism.

I stole this picture from Reddit but this is pretty much what the paint job on Hondas look like around here. It looks like Honda tried to save money by cutting back on how much clearcoat they use resulting in an early clearcoat failure 🤷"

Also I wouldn't trust whoever made that chart as their numbers seem to be pulled out of someone's rectum given BMW is in a top 10 list. BMW and Mercedes both have gone peak late stage capitalism for the past 15 years, Mercedes for the past 30 at this point. Lower quality switchgear than prior models, trash ergonomics, ugly design, and boring cars. At least BMW is trying to make back some goodwill with the B57/58 S58 platform, but I seriously can't believe it's the same brand that once made the E39, E46, E38, Z8, clownshoe, i3 etc. Like seriously, the new M5 is more obese than the average American and the G82's are absolutely hideous inside and out. The E39 was a completely timeless design and still looks modern despite being out of production for 22 years at this point. The G82's are going to be dated by 2028 at the latest. Not to mention old BMW's were a much more connected and fun driving experience than the modern stuff and didn't ship with ""comfort"" suspension that was stiff enough to pound your spine into permanent nerve damage."

They weren’t reliable at all. They also leaked on the drivers, passengers, and the marques would short out whenever it rained. I was constantly having to replace fuses for windshield wipers and gauges. 

It would take weeks to get replacement parts and if we had to send the vehicle in to the Lancaster it would take months to get the bus back from them. The BYD charging stations the company bought constantly had software issues and wouldn’t charge and they were prone to having faulty fuses that caused them to melt down internally. 

They were great when they ran tho. Instant torque, very smooth ride, very nice handling and steering. Maybe their cars are better than their buses."

I'll reserve full judgement till we get full detail pics, but, having already skipped on Markets for similar reasons, as it stands I'm starting to fear Lego is now only putting these out for the sake of putting something out, putting zero effort into reaching the high WOW factor this series is known for."

The sidewalks on the lower level gos back making this an inverted corner, same with the balcony walkways. However the technic pin holes are on all sides, allowing you to display it in any direction. But this is the proper ""front"" to the build."

The original two felt very deliberate and cohesive with their designs, with a lot of attention paid to the organization, style, and colors used in each ""level"" of the city. 

The Gardens deviated somewhat from the design language of the Movie sets, but in my opinion, improved on it greatly. The set wasn't afraid to experiment with the architectural elements and bright colors but stayed faithful to what came before. On top of that, the modularity of the set was on another level. The addition of the pagoda was the cherry on top. By far, it's my favorite Ninjago City.

Then, Markets came out. There are a lot of great elements to the set. The colors were nice and decorations added character. But the overall final product felt overdesigned and somewhat sloppy. They spent too much time integrating the gondola, creating an overly long, gappy layout. And because of the gondola, the set extends out way too far in the back, making for an odd combination with other sets. I am also personally irked by how ""square"" the buildings feel. If you look at pervious Ninjago City sets, you'll get what I mean.

And now, we have this set. It practically doubles down on everything Markets did. Overcomplicated layout that will look bad next to other sets? Check. Overly square buildings? Check. And on top of that, the color choices are just horrid. It's like I'm drowning in a sea of brown. And the decorations feel very slapped on. There are a bunch of cranes slapped onto the sides and tops of buildings. And a huge mech for a character nobody cares about. They could've put those parts towards the actual build, or maybe even a tiny 16x32 module. Maybe I'm just being overly negative. But I can't help but feel this set leaves a lot to be desired.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. I hope some of you can resonate with my opinions."

Right now if you have all five, you can arrange them into a 2x4 grid of baseplates that’s almost a complete city but is still missing one corner. So seven baseplates total. If the inevitable sixth Ninjago City set is also a corner, then you’ll be able to arrange them all like that, but that would be breaking the pattern so it’ll probably be a straight. (The best case would be for it to be a T-intersection. But that seems unlikely because it’d mean only one side is ‘camera friendly’, unless they did something really interesting like making one central building with a walkway that runs all the way around it.

Will it develop further? Sure, And it makes sense that some of the places has some of the best infrastructure around because all of it was built very recently, vs infrastructure in developed nations that has been around for a while.

And before anyone say anything, I was born in China, and my family is from there. It's far from a dystopia like some media paints it but it's also definitely not the utopia some people seems to think it is nowadays. As with almost everything in life, the truth is far more nuanced."

Rednote focuses on life inspiration, food, travel, tips, product marketing, etc. It only focuses on positive things. It does not focus on negative things and it does not focus on the life of ordinary chinese people.

I often see chinese forums with chinese people themselves discussing about why people on xiaohongshu seem so wealthy while they don't have the money or the time to do or afford those things. Based on the chinese forums i have seen, they have come to the conclusion that most of them are young people who come from well-off families and most are from the big cities. Why are there so many, you may ask? Well, because of China's huge population of 1.4 billion+ people. With a total population like that, there are bound to be A LOT of wealthy people, but also millions of poor people who make up majority. Also many say on the chinese forums that there are a few people who pretend to be wealthy on rednote too. Many of these ordinary chinese people say that they're kinda envious by what they see on rednote/xiaohongshu and wish they could afford nice things, saying that ordinary chinese like themselves usually don't post.

I don't think rednote is propaganda as it was only made for chinese and overseas chinese. It wasn't made for non-chinese people. It was only made for inspirations and marketing, so why would people post negative stuff on there? Sorta like how pinterest was made for inspirations. Nobody said it was to show the life of ordinary chinese, just inspiration for cute, fun, cool, and nice things. It's just the foreigners who think that this is what ordinary chinese live like.

For example, in the USA, we got instagram influencers who seem to live the ""perfect"" life. They are not to represent the average american however. So please, stop basing your opinion of chinese life on literal INFLUENCERS.

By the way, Rednote is the chinese version of Instagram.

Also, I think chinese people know themselves that it's best to not post anything negative about China, because CCP will most likely censor their post and ban their account if they do that.

The average per capita income per year of average chinese in China is 106,837 Yuan. Converted to USD, that is $14,604.60  
Almost half the popuation in china earn less than 1,000 yuan per month. That is around $136.72"

We're having a rough time in America right now, but it's EXTREMELY out of touch to even compare it to China. Keep in mind, most rednote users are located in cities with lots of government funding.

When you browse instagram do you think what you see on it is the norm of your country?

RedNote wasn’t even designed as a social media platform at first, but a cross border shopping app. Chinese people in foreign countries sell foreign products to Chinese people in China via this app, so obviously it wasn’t meant to target grassroots or middle class people. Even Chinese media had previously called out RedNote for being notoriously out of touch with the actual Chinese society. If you really wanna take a look at average Chinese life, go use Kuaishou or Douyin.

One more thing to add: as it is a shopping app, many fancy things you see on it are actually soft advertisements. Those videos ain’t no real vlog or casual stuff, but totally staged by professional studios, including the settings, to match the vibe of the product."

But we have extensive data that show median wealth and median disposable income (controlled for PPP) are MUCH higher in the US. Orders of magnitude higher. Amongst the top 10% of countries in the world.

It is different, and each with its own up and downsides.

Meanwhile if you are working class, you will be struggling in either country. In China you have the benefit of a very well established public transport system if you live in first or second tier cities, but the labor laws are in some ways even *weaker* than the US. The culture is also more socially conservative than the US, corporal punishment of Children is far more acceptable, the academic pressure is intense and the economy is not great for the average person at least right now--youth unemployment rate has been high recently. Finally, it is still a very authoritarian country and political dissent is close to impossible.

But also on the flip side, it is absolutely true that China's development as a whole as been extremely impressive. The most recent time I travelled back was 2018 and on the surface things were looking a lot better than back in the 2000s.

Ofc I am only speaking from what I know and my own experiences. I am also concerned about the direction the US is heading right now and it's certainly understandable why ppl want to look for alternatives, but I can at least tell you that the grass isn't always greener elsewhere."

You must be referencing this from 2020. You do know that he’s most likely referencing the total population right? Including disabled/retired/children/stay at home parents/etc and not just people in the labor market.

The total labor force of China was 783 million in 2020, how does it make sense that 600 out of 783 million make less than 136 usd a month. When the 2020 average wage in China was 97k CNY a year, over 1k usd a month. When people do average wages, it only includes people in the labor force and not total population. What you are referencing is total population.

Also your average wage stat is outdated, 107k average was 2021, 121k is 2023 and 2025 would probably be even higher."

The 996 working hours is prominent in Big Tech companies in China. However, some of these big tech companies like Tencent are slowly moving away from 996. However, big tech workers tend to be paid a high salary."

Foreign merchants requested permission to enter Fengdu City for trade, and the Emperor granted their request.

Before their arrival, the Emperor ordered the entire marketplace to be renovated—all the eaves and roofs were made uniform in appearance, luxurious curtains were set up, and the streets were filled with exquisite goods. The city was made to appear bustling and grand. Even vegetable vendors were required to place fine silk mats (dragon whisker mats) beneath their goods to emphasize the city’s wealth and refinement.

Whenever foreign merchants (Hu people) passed by a tavern or restaurant, they were warmly invited inside, given a feast, and allowed to leave without paying a single coin. They were falsely told:
""In China, wealth is abundant—food and drink are never charged.""

The foreign merchants were astonished by such generosity. However, some among them were perceptive and sensed that something was amiss. Upon noticing trees wrapped in silk, one of them remarked:
""Are there not also poor people in China, whose clothing barely covers them? Why not give them this cloth instead? What is the purpose of wrapping it around trees?""

The marketplace’s residents were ashamed and could not answer."

The other person said his memory of LM was vague, he vaguely remembered a boy with bushy eyebrows who was always glued to a blond kid named Tyler.
Although this boy doesn’t remember LM and never spoke to him, he wrote a touching article which I translated it using AI;(pic5-14) 
He also shared some photos of himself at Gilman and after graduating high school in Hawaii, but I didn’t include them due to privacy concerns. 

More:
I also found that LM's Chinese roommate in Hawaii had posted a photo of them together. (This post has been deleted )
In the comment section, the roommate said that LM was a very nice and introverted person, living a healthy life. He would buy groceries and cook at home. 
They often talked about games, and LM was proud of having participated in the making of games that his roommate liked. 
The movies they watched together included Single's Inferno, 50 First Dates, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall. 
Their daily routine is to get up at 3 a.m. to work and then go out for fun after 12 noon. 
The roommate also mentioned that he had invited LM out, but many times LM couldn't go out due to back pain.

I have decided to not shop American products, and look for Canadian alternatives instead. Today I cancelled my Netflix and Spotify subscriptions, deleted my Instagram, Snapchat, Gmail, Google, Youtube, ChatGpt, Amazon and Twitter accounts, to bring the American economy to its knees. 

But I’m left with no Canadian alternatives for those apps to use. "

The main difference between the two is the percentage of Canadian content required. 

MADE IN CANADA

Requires at least 51% of the total direct costs of production to occur in Canada 

The last substantial transformation of the product must occur in Canada 

May include a qualifying statement, such as ""Made in Canada with imported parts"" 

PRODUCT OF CANADA

Requires at least 98% of the total direct costs of production to occur in Canada 

The last substantial transformation of the product must occur in Canada 

The Competition Bureau, the Canada Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and Health Canada enforce these regulations."

There’s some American ignorance yet again…. And Canadian ignorance too.

The tariffs are a tax to the Americans.  Yes it discourages buying Canadian, but if we’re being honest…. Canada is a primary exporter and USA is a primary Importer.  

They’re still going to buy, and we will be paid the same price.  Where they can be choosey about supply, we’ll see reduced sales volumes.  The lower volumes Canada will sell to other buyers.  

For the short term while setting new trade agreements there might be a low turn in some industries like auto manufacturing, but let’s not assume our production capacity is wasted. 

There’s still global demand for our products, only now we’re not gonna be selling it cheap to the USA.  Instead we’ll be getting a better buck elsewhere at typical prices.  

I think there’s a little more Canadian fear at play than is necessary.  

Yes it is a big deal.  Yes it’s not good for our relations.  

But by no means are we “fucked” or anything.  

I don’t think most people understand the Canadian economy very well.  Exports are what we do.  It’s not a big deal to load product onto a train to the shipping port rather than a truck to the states.  

🤷‍♂️. 

And honestly, it’s the Americans who should be freaking out.  They’re cutting off their foreign supply in a bid to drive self reliance - expensive self reliance.   They have a big hurdle to overcome.  

They need the tariffs in place AND maintain buying volumes.   This generates the revenue for government to offset some of the federal income tax cut.  

Basically what is happening is USA is becoming more capitalist.  

The government money will come from purchase choices rather than income deduction.  

Meaning rich can snowball wealth easier, people in general have more money, but buying becomes relatively more expensive, and more things are made in the USA.

I mean, if you’re a capitalist country this isn’t news - this is how it used to be before our governments took on more involved roles in daily life.  

But I think American is in for a painful and hard road back there…. They will have to be very attentive to make it work.  

And might have to learn some manners along the way."

For example, say ""I want to subscribe to Spotify"". You will get an answer similar to this:  
Spotify is a Swedish company, founded in Stockholm. However, it does have operations in the United States, and a portion of its revenue flows through American markets. If you want to avoid supporting the U.S. economy, you might want to consider alternatives.  
For music streaming, **Tidal** (originally Norwegian, now owned by a European company) and **Deezer** (French) are good choices. If you're looking for a Canadian option, **Stingray Music**, based in Montreal, offers music streaming services."

\- Canadian exports to the US account for 77% of Canada’s total exports. They also make up around 19% of Canada’s GDP.

On the other hand,  
\- US exports to Canada account for 17% of US total exports. They also make up about 1.9% of US GDP.

Another key distinction that I want to highlight is that while we rely on the US to supply us the essentials such as food, pharmaceuticals, electronics, etc - on the US side of things, they primarily import oil, and wood. As for oil, the US oil imports have been on the decline since 2006 as domestic production ramped up and there as been a rise in alternative energy source (solar, wind, nuclear, etc). Since 2020, the US has produced more oil than they consume and have since become a net exporter. Combine that with Trump's pro oil policies, I think it is safe to say that the US is not dependent on Canadian Oil. As matter in fact, one of the primary goals of the United States has been to achieve energy independence which has bipartisan support and they have been working on it aggressively for the last few decades. As for wood such as Timber, the US has a pretty big local supply of their own and they can also import from elsewhere.

My point being, it is very easy for the US to replace what it imports from Canada and shift to either domestic markets, or look at other trading partners. Canada needs the US more than the US needs Canada. I don't know how this trade war will play out but there is no scenario in which the average Canadian wins. If you had to ask me, most likely, the US will want to sign some sort of a deal in which they get access to the Arctic via Canada because that is where the next geopolitical global race is shaping up to be as access to shipping lanes and natural resources worth trillions open up thanks to rising global temperatures."

At first he said the tariffs were because of poor border control and all the fentanyl coming from Canada 🙄. Canada has been pouring money and resources into the border to appease him (not that increased border security is a terrible thing), but it didn’t help a thing. 

Now Trump literally just said there was nothing Canada could do to avoid tariffs. That crushes your brother’s argument. There is no rhyme nor reason for anything Trump does. He is all over the place and you can’t trust a word he says. His motivation is always greed. Not to improve the lives of everyday Americans, but to line his and his billionaire buddies’ pockets."

Oh I think there is. It's not about the border, migrants, or fentanyl. It's about protectionism. Trump's exaltation of McKinley (Tariff Act of 1890, or McKinley Tariff), confirms it. It's also about raising revenue so Trump can cut taxes, and fund other Project 2025 initiatives. And I'm beginning to seriously think it could be about Manifest Destiny (annexation of Canada and/or others)."

As an example I pick blueberries here in BC on Canadian owned farms in the summer enough to last me through the winter. But the bushes have to be shipped up from Oregon and will be subject to tariffs. Should I not pick grown in BC blueberries cuz the bushes are from the US? 

Don’t forget most big conglomerates are traded publicly. They may trade publicly in the US but many of us Canucks own directly or indirectly shares in these companies via ETFs, mutual funds, pension funds and CPP. Conversely many “Canadian” companies (any publicly traded one on the TSX) will have shares owned by American funds and Americans. 

It’s a feel good thing to say you are “buying Canadian” but it’s meaningless otherwise."

The “shit” comes from the “便”, which doesn’t really mean anything in this context, it’s just implies the chronological order and/or causality of the two events, i.e. “from see you one eye” and then “fell in love with you”. Yeah, you can think of as “then”.

However “便” has many other meanings, one of which relates to human/animal waste. “大便” (big便) means shit, “小便” (small便) means urine. “便便” is also shit, just saying it in a cute way."

Their one and only job is to create content you want to watch, on platforms they are comfortable doing it on. If people boycotted the app, your creators would find another way to monetize their content, or even stop making content. That’s just how entertainment jobs work, TikTok is no different. 

The status quo won’t change if people continue to use products to “help” creators. Because what that’s telling platforms is that viewers now think they have a moral obligation to patronize their business, instead of simply leaving when they are unhappy. Capitalism wants nothing more than for customers to have emotional ties to products, and parasocial relationships are an easy way for platforms to convince people to stay. 

No amount of our time should be spent giving charity to big businesses."

If ppl report you enough sometimes your account will get flagged . It’s just using TikTok’s automod feature against you.  It’s not just social issues that ppl will flag for.  I followed a creator who left TikTok cuz he kept getting flagged for videos about his autistic son.  In general tho TikTok is terrible for privacy, that’s why they want to ban it.  Once you download it all your contacts information is shared to the Chinese government and anything you have on your phone is essentially seen by communist china.  So to answer your question it’s better to delete it for privacy reasons than for anything related to posting articles about trans stuff.  Ppl on TikTok don’t read anyways"

The reason you won't see them covered beyond local news channels and social media trying to break through the algorithm, is pretty obvious: the owners of the means of communication are in bed with MAGA.

And if you do seem them, prepare to face bots and useful idiots repeating the same talking points:  
There aren't any protests going on.  
Ok there are, but it's only the far-left.  
Ok maybe it's not just the far-left, but the crowds are pretty small.  
Ok they're not small, but it's because it's only immigrants.  
Ok it's not just immigrants, but they're not organized.  
Ok they're organized, but they're unlawful.  
Ok they're lawful, but they're obstructive.  
Ok the protests are obstructive, but that means they're counter-productive.  
Ok they're productive, but they're useless.  
Ok maybe they're not totally useless, but they won't change anything.

Look at the protests going on right now in Serbia, which forced their PM to resign and now are gunning for the whole corrupt pro-Russia government, even after their politicians said anyone who drove over protests would not be charged. In Georgia, which have been going for about two months andhave ground the country to a halt.  
All over Germany and Argentina, against the reactionary fascist oligarchs.  
  
There's some local news coverage here in Europe, but you really have to dig for anything else.  
Look up protests in your county and in your state, either going on right now or planned for a near future.  
Surf r/50501 if you're interested in participating. Look out for moles and bad actors.

Be aware that you can no longer afford the luxury of waiting for the most important information being delivered to your screen.  
The reason plutocrats love clowns like Milei and Trump is because you can get people clutching their pearls due to their actions and their words, instead of focusing on which laws they're passing and how people are fighting back.

If you really want hope, if you really want to know where the struggle is happening - you have to actively search for them.

Look out for russian ties and astroturfed cynicism. They're banking on *your* apathy.  
In the US the DNC is going through a *major* shift right now, just look at the actions and speeches and political backgrounds of the recently-nominated.  
It's unfortunate you have a two-party system, but do *not* ever consider arguments for 'both sides'-ism or whataboutism as anything other than jaded internet losers or outright bot armes.

Reach out and get in contact with local organizers, be aware there's bad actors in pretty much every subreddit you can find out there, and get tf off Facebook, Threads, Twitter. Instagram and TikTok are currently battlegrounds. Consider Bluesky, if you're really into it. But it's entirely on you to search for what's being planned and what's going on."

Until this country steps it up in this way, nothing will ever get better. We’ll have the same shit we’ve always had. We’ll keep getting fucked because they know we’ll just roll over and take it.

 * ""Now the **RADICAL LEFT** might tell you that Elon doing a Nazis salute means he may be a Nazi... but what if he's autistic? Anyway, here's a still frame of Kamala waving and a six-person panel to say how that's worse than what Elon did.""
 * ""Tariffs are going to make everything so much cheaper! *what's that? they're live?* **eh hem** everyone knew this was going to make things a bit more expensive, but it'll be worth it!""
* Centrist media that has fallen in line. Go on CNN's youtube channel right now and ctrl F some of the most batshit insane shit Trump's done in the last week. Trump just ordered California to dump 1.6 billion gallons of reserved water, utterly wasting it. **No videos**. Trump's Nazi owner has been fingering the treasury as of late and has promised to halt funds with no legal authority to do so. **No videos**. The GOP is trying to pass a constitutional ammendment that would give Trump another term, and is trying to overrule protections against targeted purging of voter rolls... **No videos**.

People in other countries frquently act as if Americans do not rise up because we are lazy or apathetic. That's not the case. Unfortunately, the thing that really prevents us from organizing this way in the US is that we are so tied to our jobs. 

• If we miss *a day* of work, we can lose our jobs. In many states, we have what's called ""right to work"" or ""at will work"" laws, which actually just means we can be fired for literally any reason. 

•Protesting frequently leads to arrest in the US, which means loss of work or a large bail payment. Most Americans can't afford a surprise $500 emergency. Paying bail can mean missing a bill or being late on rent, which imperils our housing.

•If an employer chooses to say we quit or ""voluntarily left"" a job, we don't receive unemployment benefits. If you didn't work enough qualifying quarters before being fired, you also do not receive unemployment benefits.

Plus, our police are jackbooted racist thugs who like to beat people down or shoot them."

There's a 1989 study which outlined the danger of for-profit mass-media called *[The Manufacture of Consent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent)*.

I'll let ChatGPT take it away:

In ""Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media,"" Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman outline five filters that shape media content and reinforce corporate and state power:

- Ownership: The first filter highlights that media outlets are often large corporations or part of conglomerates with profit motives. These owners prioritize news that aligns with their financial interests, potentially marginalizing stories that challenge corporate power or capitalist ideologies.

- Advertising: The second filter discusses how media depends on advertising revenue. Advertisers favor content that aligns with their brand image, avoiding controversial topics that might alienate consumers. As a result, media outlets are incentivized to produce content that attracts affluent audiences and avoids offending advertisers.

- Sourcing: The third filter emphasizes the reliance of media on information from government, business, and ""experts"" funded by these sources. This dependency creates a symbiotic relationship, where news outlets prioritize official perspectives, often overlooking grassroots or dissenting voices.

- Flak: The fourth filter refers to the negative responses (e.g., complaints, lawsuits, or legislative actions) that media may face if they publish content that is critical of powerful groups. Fear of flak leads to self-censorship, as media outlets avoid topics that could provoke backlash from influential entities.

- Fear Ideology: The fifth filter describes how dominant ideologies, like fear of a common enemy, shape media narratives. By framing stories through a lens of opposition to perceived threats, the media can unify public opinion in ways that support the interests of the ruling elites, often sidelining nuanced discussions or alternative perspectives."

With how much it's been going on there since their election I honestly don't blame them, things are pretty bad in my country too and our news afe even failing to properly report our protests (doesn't seem unintentional) so most people find out about this type of things through the internet (it's also a little less biased)"

Since there is an 10% import tax on oil canada could also add another 15% or more export tax to the US for this. It won't take long for americans to block the highways then, queues at gas stations for massively inflated gas, if supplies would last. Then you will get news coverage as ordinary Americans realise it is them that are paying for this BS game."

The ultimate goal of protests should be to meet with politicians, president that are willing to listen and be willing to meet with people to make those changes, not when you have someone in office NOT willing to do that, otherwise it's just for virtue signaling, and it's gotten us nowhere.

I'm using a big example here-but MLK's speech at Lincoln Memorial wasn't just an announcement.

It required Logistical operations, organizing manuals and coordinating staffs, organizers, transportation, communication, police, permits, press, food and restrooms, volunteers, what the protest was about and what they wanted out of it, speakers, musical performances, pledge and benediction, Meeting with President at the time-John F. Kennedy.

When Jan 6th happened, it was wall to wall coverage (not withstanding it was the day the election was meant to be certified) but this blanket dismissal that the media isn’t doing their job.

US citizens have been completely stripped of any social safety net, live paycheck to paycheck, work more than full time with few worker protections, and healthcare tied to employment. 

They can't just take time away from work to exercise their freedom of protest when doing so would subject them to disciplinary action by their employers. 

They would lose their livelihoods, their health coverage, and their jobs. 

Not to mention the temporary loss of income during the protests, being demonized by the press as insane radicals hell-bent on destroying the country, resulting in threats to life and limb during and after the protests. 

Add our lawless militarized police forces who have more or less carte blanche in dealing with civilian disputes. 

Qualified immunity creates a social class above reproach for violence and discrimination. 

So what you wind up with is a completely powerless neutered population on the brink of bankruptcy, homelessness, and hunger who cannot risk everything just to participate in a protest which will be maligned by the press anyway."

It's a small minority of extremely powerful psychopaths and narcissists backed up by an even smaller portion of ignorant folks, cult members, and outright idiots.

They'll defund healthcare and then go ""look, see, it's inefficient!"", they'll force-feed people with all kinds of inane bullshit and turn politics into a soap opera and defund public education and go ""see, the masses are ignorant/stupid!"", they'll raise the national debt and scream ""everyone on the other side is a leftist who doesn't understand how the economy works!"", they'll fight tooth and nail against any productive piece of regulation and go ""see, there's too much red-tape, we should just deregulate everything!"".

Broligarchs, doomsday evangelicals, and foreign interests in a perfect storm, and their only mutual interest is in undermining the very idea that democracy is possible at all, or, if it is, it just doesn't work.  
It's why autocrats love monopolies, and it's why evangelicals want to force kids into local madrasas.  
It's why Russia hates Ukraine, and it's why China hates Taiwan.  
We're talking about systems of control which almost exclusively select for self-interest at the cost of everyone and everything else.  
And that includes the planet, all life in it, and even our own species.

The truth is, as soon as those people who held power by mass manipulation saw the internet reach everyone's pockets, they panicked.  
This is their big gamble, and it involves crashing the dollar and killing the state.  
Even as they control legacy and social media companies, they know they can't dominate the conversation completely. But they sure as hell are going to make it harder for you to even *want* to struggle.  
Because what they can't control, is someone who *wants* to know what's going on, no matter how much you bombard them with messages of futility.

But most of all, remember - if your vote didn't matter, why is there so much money involved in trying to coerce you, or flat-out convincing you it's useless anyway?

I'll say it again: look up local orgs, subreddits, social media accounts for civic activism. Participate. Besides, if you're already living paycheck-to-paycheck and you're afraid of missing work for a day or two, then what have you got to lose anyway?"

We heard him when he said he wanted generals like Hitler. We are organizing and protesting in meaningful ways and some of it may not be as visible as it has been in the past. Don’t let the bots and trolls fool you.

The CDU, germanys largest Conservative Party, started a vote for a law to battle the amount of asylum seekers. This law would break EU-laws and different German laws, so it would be smashed by our courts and would never pass, but they still started this show-vote for it.

To get a majority for this law, the CDU worked together with the far right AfD which is a huge taboo.

At no point did I say you shouldn't protest. I wrote ""Protests done right take time"". What  I am saying it needs to have a purpose besides ""showing yourself and having an impact."", and wanting the media to cover. Impact is politicians, presidents taking actions. 

And you proved my point that a president not willing to listen just means catch-22 protests. You're protesting to a president, that won't listen, and because he won't listen you protest. As opposed to protesting during a time when a president is willing to listen and speak to you after the protest. 

MLK and JFK's meeting led to more meetings which led to the Civil Rights legislation. So protesting without having a legitimate goal to make changes with lawmakers is the easy way out."

So firstly: There were a couple of murders done by asylum seekers in the last couple of years in Germany. Most of them could have been prevented by our authorities because the culprits have either been known by them or officially had to be deported a long time ago.

Since we have so many asylum seekers in Germany and the laws are so complicated, we kinda lost controll over them. Our authorities lack the manpower to handle the cases quickly.

So, while the general consensus is that this situation needs to be changed, the diffrent party’s offer diffrent solutions.

The Social Democrats and the Green Party, which are part of the leading coalition, tried to find a solution to this problem together with the CDU last summer, as an alliance of Democratic Party’s, but the CDU canceled those talks out of strategic reasons. They didn’t want to help the other party’s.

And now, 3 weeks before our election, they are doing this show-vote. They wrote their own law and said, that other party’s could vote for it or against it, but they wouldn’t accept any compromise. They basically blackmailed the Social Democrats and the Green Party to vote with them, because otherwise, they would try to form a majority with the far right AfD.

And that’s were the problem for me lies. There are diffrent solutions to the problem and it’s totally okay to bring your solution to the table. But as a Democratic Party, you have to be open for compromises, you don’t blackmail other party’s and you don’t work together with the far rights under ANY circumstances."

Sometimes posts get taken down by mistake or because of automated filters. It can be annoying as fuck (i know from experience) but it doesn’t always mean there’s a hidden bias. When it comes to independent news sources there are a few that have become popular in Western media. Outlets like Al Jazeera, BBC World Service, and Reuters offer different perspectives compared to the mainstream US media. Substack and Medium let independent journalists publish their work directly to the audience without much interference. It’s true that many people rely on celebrities or mainstream news but that’s just another reason to promote media literacy and critical thinking. Encouraging people to look for different sources and question what they hear can help bridge that gap. It’s not perfect but it’s a step in the right direction towards a more informed public."

66% of Americans are in favor of deporting illegal immigrants. Of course, there is still a huge partisan bias. Of those surveyed, 93% of Republicans were likely to be in favor of deportation compared to 43% of Democrats.

However, even if people were pro-deportation in theory, the current directive of the Trump administration has given many people reason to pause. The way ICE has infiltrated our cities, our churches, and our schools is concerning. The goal of turning Guantanamo Bay into a ""detention facility"" is concerning. The fact that they're detaining American citizens is concerning.

But the second Palestine is mentioned, or Lebanon is mentioned, my post gets deleted because it’s considered as “hateful content” like pardon bitch? I put “free Palestine now & forever” once and remember Instagram deleting it about 3 minutes after. And sure, you can implore people and their opinions, but you can’t change everyone. I’ve been protesting and speaking my mind and imploring people to check out other outlets and to actually read into the right facts for as long as I can remember. It’ll never change, because it will forever tie into the lazy rhetoric that America loves to follow about freedom of speech and essentially just surrounding themselves around the idea that they deserve more, they’re worth more. They’re the most self-centered egotistical group of individuals who love to cry for help. Events are only broadcasted in very particular moments. Like Paris for example. That attack in 2015 was over all news outlets. I remember celebrities posting the same doodle of the Eiffel Tower praying for these people and trying to demoralize the idea of terrorist attacks. And it had nothing to do with America. Obviously that is all great to be spoken about, but I have never seen or read or heard anything in my life in regards to support of the Middle East. And the only time it’s in support is when Israel is mentioned. There were literal concentration camps in China that were holding Muslim individuals and eventually ending their lives. There was a terrible attack on Lebanon in 2006 (Israel bombed them) and my whole family either died or had to leave their village. Fast forward to mid-2024 and the exact same thing is happening (again, Israel bombed them) and their defense is “it’s to help defend and protect!” Okay… but you’re ethnically cleansing a country and have been for over 70 years, that country decides to finally fight back. That country is Palestine. Now you’re instantly seen as the victim and then proceed to bomb Lebanon out of defense for themselves. The fuck did Lebanon do? Just a couple examples, gets pretty old reading how far out people’s minds go on Reddit especially when it comes to this. But Reddit is a fuckin shit storm. People are either gonna love what you’re saying or hate it. No in between.

In the beginning of last year, a good friend of mine had an extremely bias questionnaire to fill out at her job in D.C. where she works in accounting. And this “questionnaire” just listed statements putting Israel as the victim and Palestine in the hot seat. And to answer or question otherwise is seen as very suspicious. Just a sliver of what America has up their sleeve. It is most definitely about what they think makes them look better, and how they can potentially benefit. Which is just hilarious to me because I don’t think a fat fuckin chunk of the U.S. population actually takes them seriously. Hence, the constant lose-lose presidential elections and then having a literal goblin as President of this country."

Yes, I also see it like this, but it's sadly not easily solvable.

For example, even if we checked the asylum seekers case in time and decided to deport them, there can be a whole lot of reasons why we can't enforce a deportation. For example, if we want to deport a person back to Afghanistan, we would have to have a diplomatic relationship with the Taliban. Also, there are countrys that we define as too dangerous to send the people back to.

Another part of the problem is that from a legal standpoint a lot of the asylum seekers shouldnt be seeking for help in Germany in the first place. The EU law basically says that the first country that they arrive to has to handle them and since Germany has no borders to Non-EU countrys, we shouldnt have asylum seekers at all. But understandably Italy and Greece (for example) can't be let alone with the amount of people coming. While Germany offers help, other EU countrys don't, which leads to a huge conflict inside the EU.  


While our left-leaning partys try to find a solution with all EU countrys, our right-leaning partys tend to a policy of isolation. They want to close our borders and leave our partners alone with the situation. We are having this discussion for nearly 10 years now and haven't found a solution yet, which led to a far-right party to gain a huge momentum. They try to offer easy solutions to complex problems with the worst intentions.

And with all this said, I haven't even talked about about the problems that (for example) our housing markets and healthcare systems are facing with the huge amount of people joining and the rise of xenophobia, because most of the asylum seekers come from muslim countrys.

It's basically an unsolvable problem and I am terrified of what will happen if we don't find a solution quickly. A huge part of our population lost their trust in our democratic partys because of it and thinks, that the far-right nationalists are the only party to be capable of fixing the problem .. And I think we all remember what can happen if a far right nationalist party in Germany takes over."

This isn't a good example to use, fwiw. One's rights to protest in Germany and the United States are far more similar than they are in the US and Afghanistan, for one. Also, the shift in the US and Germany are more recent while, sadly, the situation in Afghanistan is not new.

It's more that a bit insensitive to ask why Afghans in Afghanistan aren't protesting the conditions in their country when doing so could get them and their families murdered.

That said, there were protests by some brave souls in 2021 against the Taliban once again taking away women's rights. They resulted in violent crackdowns.

Shit like that is nothing new and it’s valid to get mad about but social media platforms have rules about what they allow people to post. Sometimes they take down posts that mention Palestine or Lebanon because they want to stop hate speech or encourage respectful conversations. You can’t blame an entire country or its people for the actions of a few. People in different countries have different opinions and it’s possible to talk about policies without being too general or personal. If we’re going by your logic, that’s basically saying who needs respectful dialogue or fact based discussions when you can just rant about how one country is the worst and everyone else is just a sheep 😂you’re making it seem like social media platforms are just censoring voices of dissent because they’re in cahoots with the government or something."

How is me posting “free Palestine, now & forever” considered hate speech and disrespectful? Meanwhile you got Wonder Woman’s dumbass Gal Gadot posting about how there are “people being held hostage and killed, being raped and tortured, beheading babies” when mind you the worst thing done was holding Israeli civilians hostage. Not beheading or raping or torturing. Nowhere near in comparison to killing off a country in chunks and calling it your own. After 70 years of being pushed and dismissed to the side, I think holding some Israeli soldiers hostage is a smidge understandable. Considering the absolute garbage that Israel has been to them over the decades. Sure as shit seems fishy to me when I post in solidarity and out of respect for my country, not even mentioning Israel and their heinous crimes over the decades, and then getting it removed because it doesn’t “meet the guidelines” and is seen as “hateful content” 
Can’t even support my own country without feeling unheard and dehumanized 😅 

I could go on and on, like about Trumps new law to get rid of undocumented immigrants. A Palestinian lawyer who is also an advocate for her country (lives in Michigan that’s where the primary population is living including me) had gone to Canada for a conference after posting on Facebook about support for Palestine. Isn’t different from what she’s been posting over the years, if anything it was a post highlighting the daily reminder that she posts in solidarity for her country and how she just wants peace and prosperity for her people. Fast forward to two days later and she was interrogated at the border, and told she couldn’t return to the U.S. for “undocumented reasons” which is funny af considering she’s been a documented immigrant living in Michigan for over 25 years now. Not saying people are in “cahoots” with the government, but it is pretty unsettling and coincidental how this shit casually gets brushed under the rug and is pretty much always taken with a grain of salt compared to the rest of the bullshit happening around us"

Not that I agre with that given that both women seem to be fantastic.

Just like after the election I saw the vitriol, racism and hate received by the latino community because they flipped to Trump.

I know the woman who wasn’t let back into America, I know what I’m saying and I find it hilarious that the reasoning is simply “documentation”. I don’t even know where your sarcasm stopped and your legitimacy started. This dumbass freedom of speech shit that America doesn’t stfu about is quite canny considering I can barely PEACEFULLY speak and support something I am passionate about without it being taken down. What’s so funny is I said what I said; I put “free Palestine, now & forever” with a small palestinian flag waving in the wind and a heart in the corner. This could be compared to literally anything. LGBTQ+ rights, Ukraine, Paris. I genuinely don’t get how this is being described as just so “one-sided” when I’m peacefully and proudly supporting a country that has been going through an ethnic cleansing for an insane amount of time. No hate is mentioned toward anyone else, no bias is being made. I want my country and my family’s country to be okay, supported, heard, and understood. Just like I would want my passion for LGBTQ+ rights to be heard, supported and understood. But instead, I should make my post incredibly vague and talk about how I want peace and freedom for everyone, despite what’s happened in the past. That’s not okay. It defeats the entire purpose. It seemingly justifies the behavior and bullshit Israel has pulled over the years. No way is a bot misreading my post in support of Palestine and taking it as a hateful statement towards anyone or anything else. 

It is understandable to put someone in a room and say “we are holding you here and we are doing this because you have been killing&torturing our people for years and wiping our name off of the map, replacing it with yours. Maybe this will stand out to your people as a sign that this is not okay and it never has been” when Israeli soldiers are literally stopping weddings to execute the groom and shoving children in the streets of Gaza so they can shoot them with a clear enough shot. Just like putting a kid in time out for doing something wrong. Just like putting an individual in jail for doing something wrong. Gotta learn your lesson, and this “lesson” they were being given didn’t even last a month after this oCtObeR 7 everyone is trying to make a remembrance out of; they were released, they went about their day, and Israel is still going on about their bullshit bombing and killing individuals in Rafah, Gaza, with not much being broadcasted about it anymore.

There was no violence towards the Israelis that were held for those few weeks. That’s why I said what I said. But raping and beating Palestinian women as well as ripping off their scarves in public is just something that doesn’t sit well with me. So comparing these monsters being held for 3 weeks in a building with running water and bathrooms and food to being held in time-out is justified. Because they’re monsters. Theres no “victim” from this. Sure we can boil it down to the specifics and yes they’re technically technically “victims” but it’s a pretty nice situation they got goin on if they’re being held in a place with proper food and nourishment being provided, as opposed to Palestinians who are shoved into a corner and left to die on the daily. Just a mild difference, I mean come on the Jews run Hollywood and pretty much America itself. Of course it’s all about Israel😂 

Also, I don’t know your opinion but I also didn’t ask, I’m just trying to educate because you seem to be more focused on what I’m saying about America and hostages being put in “time-out”. if there were Israeilis that were tortured and killed at that time, I wouldn’t be saying what I said. But that’s the gem is they were perfectly fine and they still are. The straight sparkle of it all though is they’re STILLLLL getting away with it as I’m typing this. They’re still killing individuals and ruining lives to this day. My uncle and his family actually passed away from a missile that hit their home in Lebanon about 4 months ago. Oh and my best friends aunt and her 3 year old daughter were left to die in the streets of Palestine about a week ago. Won’t change a thing! 

I truly truly hope this never happens to you or your loved ones and that people of your ethnicity are never diminished and shoved to the side. Now I’m done."

I've been browsing Xiaohongshu for a few days and observing Americans for a few days, and I've come to some conclusions:  

1. Americans who come here span all social classes. In reality, they are very thoughtful, politically savvy, and highly capable, not the lower-class individuals as described by public intellectuals.  

2. They desperately want to change some things, but unfortunately, it's very difficult to do so. Their current society resembles the state of China's feudal Ming Dynasty in its final years, with the added oppression of the Qing Dynasty's literary inquisition. It's as if they have been blindfolded and tied up in a specific room, with each person enslaved. They are aware of their situation but cannot escape or change it. There are various contradictions—horizontal, vertical—they are fragmented, and everyone is trapped in their own box, unable to move. They know this, but there's nothing they can do. Each group represents the interests of a certain group of people, and everyone's viewpoint seems reasonable. No one can convince anyone else, and no one dares to betray their own circle and class, as the consequences would be even worse. This is more terrifying than moral 绑架 (moral kidnapping); even if you flip the table, it's useless. There is no unity of thought, and you can't do anything. Whatever you do is wrong. You have the heart to fight, but not the power to change the situation.  

3. Many of these reasons stem from historical burdens, and many are deliberately set by the upper echelons—infighting, shifting blame, lies. You can suspect, but you can't find evidence. 

4. Capitalists should really all be h***ed from the streetlights."

Conflict is solely through ideologies first, and fueled by the material—rather than how material conditions may beget ideologies. 

Example: American expansion into the west is always characterized as some sort of “pioneering spirit” or some such lofty ideal. Many such authors romanticize this OR vilify the imperial methods used to oust Native Americans from their lands as something intrinsic the Euro or Anglo identity—I don’t even discredit these narratives, to be clear, but these are a dime a dozen. 

But why go to these lengths when a materialist analysis is easier? A burgeoning empire on the cusp of civil war (and indeed, recovering some civil war afterwards) tried to subsidize the development of land by offering *free real estate* to their citizens. I mean, sure you’ll hear this perspective sometimes as it being *basic*, but I find that the material has been dropped entirely for the loftier explanations in more modern times."

A seldom mentioned advantage that Chinese people have in their bag is a distinctly political history of thousands of years.

People discount, or don’t even know, that around the time of the great Greek thinkers flowered an age of political theorization in ancient China that puts even modern thinking to shame. People thought about the optimal ways to rule harmoniously, how to balance law and punishment, what virtuous rule even meant. These are things we don’t do even today in the West.

When I noticed the individual mention the Ming Dynasty, I couldn’t help but notice this trend again. Every dynasty has a story to tell of their operations, efforts and solutions in regards to ruling this same area that is China today. It hit home when an Iranian general said that America has no heroes, because we also have no real history that we draw on either.

The West’s discounting of Eastern history and their own focus on their own legacy and values above the lessons available to them now will be a heavy factor in their downfall. On my shelf I have a book I picked up in a Chinese museum in Beijing contrasting the theories of Chinese thinkers in Han times to Greek thinkers of the same period. You better believe there are myriad books in the same vein, all in essence contrasting, learning and taking the useful synthesis while Westerners sit on their Platonic laurels patting themselves on the back."

This tactic exploits the fact that most people don't have (and have not had the opportunity to acquire) the education, training, and/or experience to even know where to start on that stuff even fewer have the patience and tolerance for boredom, and most of the people who do have those things have been beaten down into submission and/or have been recruited into the system.

However, with what's happening to the federal bureaucracy right now, I predict that getting enough wonks to hash out the nuts-and-bolts practicalities for implementation may soon be less of an issue…"

People thought about the optimal ways to rule harmoniously, how to balance law and punishment, what virtuous rule even meant.

In the book of Han (~100CE), a quote appears. “Food is the first necessity of the people”. Xi Jinping has been quoted as having repeated this phrase, wisdom which also lines up with his administration’s concentration on materially uplifting the poorest in China. Mao Zedong was fairly prodigious in his use of ancient phrases and quotes as well not to mention inspiration from ancient philosophy.

Second, to say that the US uses Greece and Rome pales in comparison to the lengths of what I meant. You’ll find fasces behind the podium of the Senate house, and Doric columns on the White House. But in comparison to what I just said above on Xi, no. In fashion and form, sure. But Western rulers these days rarely if ever pay heed to the lessons of the past. Otherwise the Melian Dialogue would’ve already made its way into the national consciousness regarding Ukraine for example.

Lastly, I mentioned that there is myriad Chinese books on Western thought. I dare say that China’s rise was an example of them taking any kind of Western lead and following it especially in regards to management, technology, and administration and philosophy. Japan did the same. 

The West has a problem in that in their brief victory over the world owing to technology they have based their success in their inherent way of thinking. They celebrate the Greeks and Romans, and that’s pretty much it. They discount everyone else, while everyone else was busy incorporating Western thought into they own and forming a synthesis that is now forming a world marked by Asian dominance.

The only thing I think the US uses as a precursor is Roman/Athenian style aggression as their form of foreign policy. Otherwise, “Democracy” is a worn out dress draped over tyranny of capital, and “liberty” is a coping mechanism for those who haven’t realized the capitalist oligarchy owns their material and working life and thus their own life."

I'd say if you have to pick one delete Reddit, and if you were to pick a second one then delete Tiktok. I think Tiktok is by far the worst one for ADHD, cause it literally thrives on your poor attention span and hijacked reward system. And reddit is the worst for the nsfw. Plus there is a lot of degenerate content/comments on here."

You get that urge, go on a run, make some food, do something active. And if you find that impossible then tell yourself you’ll jerk it after. And chances are you’ll find that urge gone afterward, and even if it isn’t at least there’s a healthy trade-off of shorts.

Your brain is chasing those easy dopamine hits, but to the extreme. Cause it knows that it can be that stimulated multiple times a day, and it’s easy. Once you redefine that system with less jerking off, and other things that flow dopamine it’ll be much easier."

I've deleted and redownloaded TikTok on Google Play several times and it was fine. Strange that it's not working on your device.

There's also the option to not log in but that doesn't create a lot of resistance. I do think OP should experiment with different things until they get better outcomes.

I understant how the algorithm works. I even hit not interested. And yet it keeps feeding me the content.

My Tiktok used to be normal. Full of booktok, ASMR, those weird AI cat videos, house inspectors, and random other videos. 

I had blocked so many things, mostly child death, kid death...ect , because anxiety. 

I have been served SOME MANY  kids death videos!!!.
No I don't want to see those. 

Also it keeps trying to convince me to like the new press taking lady?????? Video after video about her and how she is better then the last person. I DONT CARE. 

it's also FULL of right wing people trying to convince me they were right or something about trump. 

It's also un followed people .

Like I hate going on there now. It's full of politics and death. 
I used to go on there to get away from everything. 

I hate what has happened in that app. Reddit feels like the only safe place now. "

While researching about refreshing the algorithm, if you turn off personalization algorithms off from your settings, do not turn it back on till 24 - 48 hours. What you have to do is to scrub search history, watch history, unlike some video you deemed unnecessary or you can save the link for next time. Clear data, etc

While you are in the non-personalized algorithm, interact by searching videos on TikTok and interact till 24 - 48 hours is up."

It really does work. Then spend the next hour searching up the topics YOU DO WANT TO SEE. Comment on all those videos with 7 words or more. You can also open the share button and copy the link because that increases those videos on the algorithm.

Then on your fyp you need to 'not interested' everything you don't want to see. You should try this before you decide to leave TikTok."

I don't like ASMR and LIVE videos. I was getting LIVEs every 3 videos and ASMR every 5 or so. I was hitting ""Not Interested"" and it seemed to actually be giving me more, I think that's how I ended up with so many of them. I was scrolling past videos that could have been good because I knew there was a LIVE again in 3 videos I could hit Not Interested on.

I'm pretty sure they count clicking Not Interested as interaction. The button does jack shit, and was actually making the problem worse the way I was using it.

The algorithm is designed to keep you on the app. So basically the moment I got a LIVE video, or something I don't like, I closed the app on my phone and didn't re-open for 20 minutes. Now my feed has returned to normal.

This behavior also happens on Facebook and Snapchat. If you hit ""Not Interested"" it shows you more of that kind of content because you interacted with it. Stop using that function. Use your attention as leverage. Go do something else, you'll be happier and your feed will improve.

Honestly, I think it's the best way to do it. A few months ago I kept getting a bunch of anti-men content. In the woods with man vs bear bullshit, etc. I took a month long break from TikTok and now they don't show me like, anything related to that. Taking a break from TikTok may actually be beneficial to restoring your algorithm. You can call it a protest or whatever, but if it's functionality baked in to keep you on the app, then your only leverage is your attention."

When that changes, the application seems to behave odd, off, and you grow frustrated but the idea is that eventually you get used to it and keep consuming what they are providing you - self brainwash if you think about it. 

TikTok changed (during the outage) to lean ultra right pro-Trump, because it’s priority change to normalize their behavior and serve you propaganda. 

It is yet one more truth social or Facebook or Twitter. It is the same on news papers and cable news.

Making you crave the videos but overall slowly making your life worse off than it was before. Slowly breaking you down and killing your attention span.

Find or MAKE a new offline or online space that can be how TikTok was to you.💞

If you comment on it. You will guaranteed be shown something similar next. 

Algorithms are awful. They totally ignore people who are doing groundbreaking or innovative things. And they reward you for doing the same. 

There's a reason why kids today, Have the same favorite bands as I did 20 years ago. The internet destroys societal culture development. 

Have a new idea? Could be the best in the world. For example, If Trump wants to make tick tock America 50% owned by the government. He should make it partially a public access channel. Where people can actively see legislation, discuss in a bipartisan way. And even like our dislike to hold people accountable. 

No one will ever hear this. Because it's boring. If I did it while doing some insane stunt maybe. 

And the algorithm will always be boss, because it's what makes money. There's nothing more upsetting to me than stumbling upon a tiktok channel. That is really really good. About anything. But because it doesn't follow certain rules, it's not shown to anybody. 

Are for example I've had videos Shadow band. Because I was outside in the cold and breathing air. It thought I was smoking."

- block Facebook, instagram, dt, etc. Somehow that helps to reset the algorithm 

- as for the “not interested” option, don’t press it. that still counts as engagement and feeds you more. Which is wild, but somehow that’s how they have it. Same goes for using the search bar while still on the video. Watching any length of the video also counts as engagement. Scroll ASAP. 

- you mentioned cat videos and booktok, which I assume are some interests. Search up those tags, things related to those tags. Go through and spend some time in the search section for those. Mass like a bunch of the videos. This will help to reset your algorithm too. 

- I’m unsure if this will help much but go in and clear your cache as well before doing the mass liking of topics you are interested in. 

- to help reduce the videos in your fyp, don’t search or engage in any content that could feed into it. No funny kid videos, no medical related things, etc."

I'm not posting all of this to try to educate someone who may already be knowledgeable but to share things with anyone willing to look. 

La Palma detention center has recorded atrocities upon transgender inmates from trumps covid era. With letters snuck to the outside of the disturbing details. They are still locked up if they are still alive.

He's is not as dumb as everyone thinks. It is a power play to prevent too much worry too soon. 

He's literally the decendenant of 2 Hitler buddy buddy nazis.

 His direct paternal side dislikes him because he went with the ""family business"" after they worked hard to distance themselves from the other side and avoided service under hitler. 

He is not dumb, he is highly skilled and playing the conservatives to back the white nationalists. The Heritage Foundation is hands in hand with the American Nationalists Foundation, they are openly partnered. 

Musk - paying into neo nazi groups around the world
All budding with other billionaires. Like Hitler did too.


Musk is giving money to neo nazi parties across the ocean. 

Both are openly supporting fascist nationalist ideals 

Nationalist? You mean the german NATIONALIST PARTY. WHICH literally translates to Nazi? Yeah, nationalism is always began with the promise to make our country great, poison within, tarrifs to crash the stock to force NATIONALISM. It's not that hard. Did you know Germany killed all their transgender prisoners? 
Did you know that Berlin was the hub for transgender medicine before they burned down everything? Specifically burning all sexual and gender education materials? 

The Forgotten History of the World's First Trans Clinic | Scientific American https://search.app/rcLYQBYqQafB6dg8A

14 steps of fascism as described by Umberto Eco. All 14 describe a MAGA America. 

1. Cult of tradition - old religion and values. Like precise interpretation of constitutions of other books of laws.
2. Rejection of modernism and a distaste for science. 
3. ACTION for action sake. Just do it! Storm the Capital!
4. No analytical criticism.  science promotes disagreement and reasoning. Fascism disagreements are treason and criminal. 
5. Fear of difference. No ethnic or sexual variations. 
6. Appeal to the middle class. Great again. When I was a child. I remember when. Before *minority*
7. An obsessive plot. And the plot is from inside. ""Ememy within"" ""poisoned blood.""
""Illegals"" ""criminals on the loose"" ""deep states"" ""fake news""
8. A privileged (disadvantaged) minority. (DEI) (dreamers) (work visa) (scholarships) (welfare)
9. Empathy is the treason. Pacifism. Tolerance. ""We are at ware for our way if life! Under threat!"" Most recently now ""the sin of empathy"" 
10. Contempt for the weak. ""Weak vs real americans"" ""americans on handouts"" ""americans on assistance"" ""americans with disabilities"" ""mentally ill are just criminals"" 
11. Cult of Heroism and Saviors. 
""I'm the only one that can help you"" ""greatest ever"" ""We are better than others"" ""we must save our country!"" 
12. Machismo. The rise of toxic masculinity and forced toxic femininity of all other classes. Anti homosexuality, anti empathy, pro force. Anti consent. Pro privilege. A disdain for women and a condemnation of lgbt. 
13. Selective populism. A majority is meaningless individuals as individuals have no rights. The majority is the only group that matters, and will be treated for all intents and purposes as ""the people"" for ""the people"" and the leader the voice of ""the people""
14.  News speak speech. Drawing on an impoverished vocabulary. Using elementary syntax. Limit complex or critical reasoning by using very simple language. Leader must be skilled at ""newspeak"".

And why is that if I may ask?

If you want to give rights to some, you have to take away from others.

Diversity hiring is racist and sexist.

You take the rights from the majority of white men looking for jobs, then to give it to a few privilege minorities.
That is wrong on so many levels.

You have gone full circle, where laws were/are being made so some people In the past: black people, today: straight white males. have a disadvantage in society and getting jobs.

It's mindbogglingly that people openly support this kind of racism and sexism.
And don't give me that crap about  men having the right to vote.

In the Danish kingdom, only 48% of men had the right to vote before women and the rest of the 52% landless/poor men got the right to vote.

Feminism today has purposely left out the fact that majority of men didn't have any rights, and use this as a argument to get gender hiring in to government.

Don't get me wrong, I support equality between men and women.
But I don't support laws that give privileges to the few and put disadvantages on the majority, as in gender/diversity hiring.
Equality dose not mean 50/50 between women and men.

Equality means that every ""Person"", no matter the gender, nationality or race, will have a fair shot at getting the job, where work experience and/or education is the main deciding factor.

Gender, race, culture is unimportant in a equal society.
Your actions should speak for your success, not what family or ethnicity you are.
These are the fundamental principles any fair and just government should follow.

In Texas after banning abortion the material mortality rate went from 11%- 56%, in March 2022- December of that year 216 infants died because of childbirth complications over half of that their mothers died too, it has been found that at least a fourth were preventable. Undocumented immigrants paid $96.7 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022, there's not data for 2024 but it's presumed they paid more. Most of that amount, $59.4 billion, was paid to the federal government while the remaining $37.3 billion was paid to state and local governments, UNDOCUMENTED immigrants (they're not illegal bc if they were then so am I as a European) will never see the money they paid, they don't get tax returns and their social security benefits start from they day they get documentation, so immigrants have paid over $2k per person on income taxes while everyone else pays $1.6k yet that money goes to my social security benefits and not theirs??? In the US the only way for someone to actually be illegal is if they swam here and don't have a job or a house or  literally fucking anything you need an id for because every single immigrant that actively lives in our society has an INTN number that works exactly like a social security"

It goes on to break down abortion views by political affiliation, religious views, age, race, and how this has changed over time."

Feminism in the United States has always been about equality, do some women get hired to hit a specific dei number? Yes they do, do they get paid the same amount as their male coworkers? No they don't, even if they are more qualified for the position then them. Taking away the laws that force companies to not just hire straight white men isn't helping anyone, its just keeping qualified people out of the workforce because some random 60 y/o man doesn't think women should be lawyers."

Anyway, it's a stupid argument, to demand some kind reimbursement about something that happened in the past, to people that are long gone.

If you are talking about second wave feminism, yes you are right, it was all about equality, that is not the case today, because they want to be above men, have sexist law that give special rights/privileges only to women, get paid higher than men.

Your wrong, Gender/diversity hires are not better qualified for a job, they are typical a worse option for the job, less qualified, but they have the law on their side that gives them a unfair advantages. On a capitalist standpoint, it makes no sense to hire less qualified people because they have the ""right"" gender and skin colour 


And when we talk about pay, few western, if any western country allow different pay dependent on gender.
It's illegal to pay a women less.

It's a know fact that women work less hours than men, and they work way less overtime, and work less-paying jobs. so it's self explanatory that they get on average less money then men.
And it's idiotic to try to change that.

You need unjust and tyrannical laws to be able to change that, 
And the most scary thing is that there are alot of people that support the injustice, they pass racist and sexist laws that deliberately put white men at a disadvantage, granting the minorities special rights and treatments."

The U.S. consumer has to pay for the tariffs. U.S. companies that pay for products overseas in other countries have to pay additional income tax towards the U.S. government therefore they’ll raise prices of goods in America to make up for the loss of profit and in the process the U.S. consumer has to pay more.

I avoided the typical topics to avoid with Chinese apps. I tried appealing but that didn't work.

It only prevents me from interacting, I can view everything still. But I'm just really curious what I did that butthurt the CCP so bad.

It feels like that leniency is fading. Lately, my feed is full of warnings about what not to post to avoid shadow bans—now people are getting suspended. I’m taking the hint. No politics, no sex, no talking about certain past historical events, no drugs. Just leave it all out.

By now, we understand the basics of Chinese culture. We’re not TikTok refugees anymore. We’ve become part of the community, and they expect us to follow their standards. But I respect how they handle it. Instead of taking offense like some of Western culture does, they welcome us and guide us. They acknowledge our ignorance while teaching us their view of respect. They don’t demand that respect they subtly earn it."

I've been using RedNote for a while now, and while I appreciate the platform and some of the content, I've noticed a trend that's leaving me a little unsatisfied. I'm finding that a lot of the information feels a bit superficial. It's great for a quick overview, but it doesn't really delve deep enough to truly enrich my learning experience.

I'm wondering if others feel the same way? Are you hoping for more insightful and comprehensive content?

I've seen some articles on RedNote about fat burning, but they tend to just scratch the surface. They might mention general tips like ""eat healthy and exercise,"" but they don't go into the science behind fat burning, discuss different training methodologies (HIIT vs. LISS, for example), or explore the role of hormones and nutrition in a detailed way. I'd love to see content that explores these aspects more deeply, perhaps with links to scientific studies or expert opinions.

I understand that RedNote might be aiming for a broad audience, but I think there's definitely a demand for more in-depth content. Perhaps they could offer different tiers of content, or create more specialized sections for those who want to dive deeper into specific subjects.

What are your thoughts? Do you feel RedNote's content could be more insightful?"

In-depth always ends up in discussing problems.

Let's enjoy one different, friendly social network, without boobs and twerking and gay content and violence and people argueing and hating each other.

I hope Rednote stays the way it is now."

That was so lame. 

IMHO, the Chinese government truly messed up big time because of their ridiculous handling of online information. 

This also reminds of how DeepSeek opts to avoid politically sensitive questions entirely rather than articulating their stance,, the Chinese government overall missed a great opportunity to communicate their perspective to the world—an unfortunate oversight."

post,My art VS inspo pic! Inspo from @September elm秋榆 on Rednote! Also a question regarding starting out.,DefiantExplorer9957,71,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1idxfkx,2025-01-30 21:02:05+00:00,4.0,Nails,"Hi all! 

I’m a beginner nail stylist based in Amsterdam, and after a two-year break, I’ve recently started doing nails again. I stopped because I felt a bit demotivated and lacked the knowledge I needed to feel confident in my work.

Right now, I’m practicing on press-ons (not for sale), and yesterday, I applied for a nail tech course starting in May. I’m really excited to learn more techniques, but also to deepen my understanding of safety, hygiene, and allergies—because I want to start doing nails professionally on clients.

I’m sharing my work because, honestly, I’m really proud of myself for creating this set with limited supplies. I’m on a budget, but I’m slowly building my collection when I can. This set was inspired by September Elm on Rednote.

My goal is to practice as much as possible before the course, learn more about social media, and start working on real hands—starting with friends and family. I also wanted to ask for advice: how did you transition from practicing on people to taking paid clients? I’m considering asking for a small fee at first to cover materials while building my portfolio, but the jump from free sets to charging makes me feel a bit nervous and insecure.

What were your experiences with this transition? Any advice would be super appreciated!"

While you can directly access all websites in China, Chinese people cannot directly access websites such as Google, OpenAI, Reddit, X, Facebook, YouTube, nor use these apps.  
If your app requires an internet connection, it must complete ICP registration in mainland China, and your app must not access services that are blocked in mainland China, such as Google and OpenAI.  
Unless you establish a company in China, there seems to be no other way to complete ICP registration. Your app also cannot access domains that are prohibited in China and will have to opt for local alternatives."

I joined Rednote a few weeks ago and ever since it seems like the amount of scam phone calls I get has slightly increased. Nothing crazy, but enough to make me question if I've done anything different lately and that would be it.

I don't have my number public, anywhere, and I use the screening function on my phone so that I'm never directly answering any calls.

I also have two different identity protection companies in place to constantly scan for my info on the dark web and they've not hit on anything.

Anyone else experience the same?

Current Issues:

1. Number change is only for people who typed a few digits wrong or used the wrong country code
2. We have no idea when or if Pi will be listed on an exchange or which exchange

Please see these answers to commonly asked questions, if this doesn't answer your question, hopefully, someone else will. 

* Q1: **I have x coins migrated, what to do?**
* A: Wait till Open Mainnet - High chance of being scammed by strangers

* Q2: **A KYC slot is not available**
* A:  You haven't completed 30 mining sessions or your account is flagged. You can appeal at minepi.com/kyc-application-access but nothing is known about slots or criteria. There's absolutely nothing you can do to get a resolution quicker.

* Q3: **My Application has been processing/in review for weeks/months/years**
* A: Your application failed or got stuck. Wait until PCT code a resolution or you get directions in the app. 

* Q4: **KYC, Wallet or other parts of Pi app stuck on ""Loading"" or ""Error""**
* A: Try turning off Private DNS and/or adblocker. Clear app cache, reboot device. 

* Q5: **I'm under 18 what can I do about KYC**
* A: Put your date of birth in at the start of KYC - timer will disappear until you turn 18.

* Q6: **Name changes required or failed**
* A: You can appeal to change your name. If appeals fail you can spend Pi to change the name. 

* Q7: **What is tentative approval?**
* A: Tentative approval means your account needs further security checks. 

* Q8: **Why is Pi worth $50+?**
* A: Some exchanges invented their own version of Pi whilst they can't list the real one. These are commonly known as ""Pi IOU"". 

* Q9: **I lost my passphrase or wallet compromised/pi stolen, what can I do?**
* A: Create a new wallet and confirm it on steps 3 and 6 of the Mainnet Checklist.

* Q10: **Will I lose all my Pi?**
* A:  Unverified Pi is mostly finders fees for referrals. If they don't complete the process you won't receive the finders fee. 

* Q11: **When will I get paid for verifications?** 
* A: We don't know. 

* Q12: **When will my migration happen / I have been waiting for ages**. 
* A: There's a massive queue. As of 5th Feb 2024, only 9.9M accounts have been migrated. View progress at https://explorepi8437.pinet.com/

* Q13: **When is Open Mainnet?**
* A:  Q1 in 2025 

* Q14: **I stopped getting validations**
* A: An algorithm demoted you and your account needs a new verification.  

* Q15: **blurred Camera problems**
* A: It's a problem caused by your device - Log on a different device.

* Q16: **Unverified Pi Questions**
* A: Bonus Pi from referrals who passed KYC has not been processed yet. We don't know when it will be. 

* Q17: **Can I trade Pi on HTX / Bitmart etc**
* A: You can't deposit or withdraw  - can only trade their ""IOU"" version of Pi. 

* Q18: **400 error**
* A: We don't know what causes this. 

* Q19: **How can I sell Pi?**
* A: 99% chance of being scammed. Wait till Open Mainnet. Bans for offering to buy/sell Pi. 
   
* Q21: **I don't know anything about Cryptocurrency!**
* A: There are free courses on this website: https://cryptosavingexpert.com/courses?show=all

Although, I find it's less of an issue in practice because you can infer the meaning from the context. I also find it's easier to get tones right when speaking a sentence than individual words because you just follow the cadence there. My advice is to just not worry about it too much and try to listen and mimic what you hear as much as you can. People will understand you."

yes China and the CCP do bad things, we can all agree there as no country is perfect but when we compare the life the Chinese ppl have compared to the US and the current attitude the Western World has to the US i believe we may see the start of a cultural and geopolitical shift.

Now china has a somewhat even field (even with all the conservative backlash) and people see china as a novety and something closer to them. If you ask me, all the brainwashed people to consume stuff from the west (like people who are openly xenophobic against china) will be target for their propaganda, meanwhile the majority will try stuff from both sides and decide what they like more. if they enjoy more china its a skill issuee from the hegemonic west. And finally people brainwashed by china will have more resistance towards west stuff. 

In my opinion the globalization should be both ways and for 90% of the recent history it was centered on the west, thats how they got their hegemony"

Thus,  Iran, Russia,  and other countries begin the flow to China as it moves in a better direction. 

The Western World has a lot of propaganda to reject before noting how the countries within could be doing better. 

America,  for example,  is beginning to have more people talking directly to Chinese citizens without a media that is beholden to the ruling class.  Without that filter,  citizen journalism has effectively created a new consciousness not seen since before the Cold War. 

So it'll take more time for people to begin to note the great disparity which was US propaganda and do more to put America on a different path. 

Same applies to other countries."

About 8kms (hour paddle) away from a portage I heard a huge commotion. Must be Americans I thought. Sure enough, 12 muscular, and macho, young American fellas were struggling through a short portage: sooo much confusion and splashing. Soooooo much nice gear. Mind you, it's been an hour now. We got to chatting. Nice enough guys. I still had to wait for them to get out of the way. 

They were shocked and amazed that I was by myself. I'm not bragging but as a middle aged father, I like to see if I still got ""it"" and I single tripped the portage. Took me two minutes to get going. As I walked away, canoe on head, I heard their amazed comments. And I thought to myself, ""this is how an American invasion would go"".

Biden is a career politician, but nowhere is he  simply a 'better' version of Trump.

Edit for clarity:
For all his faults, Biden worked as a public servant in the capacity he knew to be moral and upright. At points he may have been mistaken, misled, or maybe even politically incorrect and creepy weird as old men do. But I believe he is a decent person deep down. He is not even on the same plane as that orange shitstain on humanity, that try as you might, you couldn't tweak a few knobs to simply make a Biden into a Trump"

According to new data from analytics firm Similarweb, Rednote gained nearly 3 million U.S. users in a single day last week, increasing from 700,000 daily active users to approximately 3.4 million.

During this online encounter between Chinese and American netizens, fun phenomena are observed, such as charges of 'cat tax', free English tutors and cross-check bill books......
 (Cat Tax: Chinese netizens jokingly asked the American newcomers to share pictures of their cats before navigating this app.)

It also sparked a broader conversation about the growing presence of Chinese companies on the global stage, including advanced electric vehicles, smartphones, and tech gadgets...... As of Jan 23rd, 2025, there were 308 Chinese companies listed on the US stock market with a total market capitalization of $652.32 billion, according to Stock Analysis.

Whether or not you've paid the ""Cat Tax"" on RedNote, here's a list of Chinese companies going global, curated by Moomoo for investors. Check them out! "

Due to the current political situation regarding transgender existences, we have implemented several emergency measures to keep this community safe.  Please read this in full.
1.  **IF YOU HAVE AN URGENT ISSUE, DO NOT POST IT EXPECTING IMMEDIATE RESPONSE**.
2.  Many posts are sent to the queue for manual approval based on numerous factors.  This is how we keep the subreddit safe from many (but not all) bad actors who try to post disruptive content.  This approval process is usually resolved within 24 hours, but can take several days depending on the availability of our all-volunteer moderators.  ***DO NOT MESSAGE THE MODERATORS*** asking for your post to be approved.  It will be reviewed and approved or removed in time.
3.  We are not approving posts with little to no history on Reddit all-together, no matter the question.  Period.  This means that if you are using a throwaway account with little to nothing in its history, your post **will not be approved**.  Period.   We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.  ***DO NOT MESSAGE THE MODERATORS*** asking if your account with 5,000 karma and a dozen posts counts as ""little to no history"" (it doesn't) or if we will give you a pass and approve your post anyway with it being your first post ever (we won't).  This message is being put on all posts regardless if it meets the criteria or not.
4.  Many comments from low-karma users will not be viewable by anyone.  This is by design.
5.  If you are curious if your post is visible or not, look at the ""Insights"" on the post.  If it has more than a dozen views, it is live.  If it has any voting action, it is live.  If it doesn't have a little red trash can icon, it is live.  If it can be voted on, it is live.  Do not message us asking ""is my post live?""
6.  Please be patient with us, we are all volunteers, lack sleep, and the entire permanent team are members of the transgender community ourselves... we are trying to deal with the same atrocities you are.  Thank you for your understanding. <3

If I don't post and get validation from the community then I feel worse. If I post and my shit gets stolen and I get ridiculed by a bunch of people that I never have talked to, okay? 

A lot of people are saying that they get hate and nasty comments on all sorts of social media platforms. I have not other than here on Reddit where I defend myself. So, on Facebook I only ever see my friends feeds and nothing from the general public. I don't have an Instagram and I don't have a Twitter. I have a YouTube account but I don't have it tied to anything and I don't follow anybody. I literally use it to watch pokémon and car crash videos. 

I never see the hate that you guys see. Maybe I'm wrong in that regard but I'm not going to stop what I'm doing, because that is part of the plan, scare us back into the shadows and negate any resistance."

Every brother that feels joy at being able to shave for the first time, every sister that sees how beautiful she can be when she masters her makeup, every enby that is able to choose what feels right for them and every intersex person for being wonderful complications on a simpleton's understanding of gender.

We all simply asked the question, ""Who am I?"" For some people this is an easy question, for others it takes years of transition.  Both are valid, and every person should still re-evaluate how true their answer is to them in the now.  I myself still think of myself as a trans woman, though everyday I feel like just saying I'm a woman is the right way to put it.  I don't feel uncomfortable by transition but I know it will not define me forever, one day I will have completed my transition, but I won't forget who are my people."

This has been a known issue for years, and even more known that Facebook doesn't care about community standards violations.

If you post online you should be fine with whatever you post getting out there and possibly stolen by bigots to mock you/us. Sucks, but it's reality.

Regardless If you notice the hatred or not it still takes courage to be open about who you are to strangers (IRL or online) just remember to check out terms of service & policy changes on your platforms from time to time incase the company themselves uses hate speech against us even though they still claim to be ""inclusive""

I was curious what you were trying to communicate with this comment (not really, it would have been rhetorical, I knew what you were saying), checked your comment history and saw.

The State of Idaho has already introduced legislation to redefine marriage to once again be strictly defined between a man and a woman, and their legislature is on record as saying that this is intended to give the SC the opportunity to overturn Obergefell.

Your reward for being ""one of the good ones,"" will be the same as the punishment ""for the bad ones.""

And regardless, I will continue to fight for, advocate for, and defend your right to marry who you will, your right to not face discrimination in the workplace or denied your healthcare.

Because solidarity has nothing to do with your personal opinions about any trans person, or any member of the trans community. It's about the difference between right and wrong and the simple acknowledgement that if they are coming after you, they are coming after me.

I hope you will learn who had your back when you didn't have theirs and I hope it happens before it's too late and you have your own moment of, "" there was no one left to speak out for me.""

Good luck, and stay safe. You're going to need it."

A group of magas have been infiltrating various fandoms to spread hate speech and try to take ownership while complaining about all the progressive parts of those communities acting like those weren’t always a part of those movements.

Cheaper.  So while a reasonable person would think ""illness? society should help treat it!"" we are not a reasonable society.  Rather, the ""mentally ill"" stand in the way of progress and are disposable.  If we accept that label, then we accept those consequences.

(That isn't how it should be, of course.  ""Mentally ill"" people are often completely asymptomatic with proper care!  Buy someone $30 in antipsychotics and they pay thousands of dollars in taxes over their life.  That's just a smart investment.  But, we like to hate, so we withhold treatment instead, and then have someone to hate.  Withholding *our* treatment also makes us easier to hate.  That's the common thread.) 

I have more sympathy for people that use terms like ""testosterone poisoning"" and ""birth defect"" though those are also hurtful and I avoid them myself.  When other people use them I think ""I see what you're cooking"" but that's about it ;)"

China was never India's Neighbor, Tibet was. and historically Tibet is MORE INDIAN than Chinese.From culture to language.  
The reason Tibet was not part of India is, Himalayan region was never invaded by India because it was a free land, holy place, barren.

Some fu\*knuts points finger towards India saying People with Mongoloid features can't be Indian, only Chinese.  
God!  
India is insanely diverse, from middle eastern looking to very close to African we have everything,  
There are 8-9 states In India where people with mongoloid feature lives. even in entire North Bengal which is Kinda mainland.

I have a deep desire to see Tibet is free or willingly joining India before I die.  
I praise China's development, but the compromise they do with culture is insane, they destroyed a significant portion of Tibetan culture."

Also the Mughals tried multiple times to rule the NorthEast, but failed, otherwise it would have been another province of the Mughals. 
     
And yes, The Northeast was never a part of India, so was any other state in India. Do you think South Indian states and North Indian states would have united to form a country if not for the British?

No Indian king ever ruled any of the northeastern states. The region became part of India only under British rule. India should have left Northeast India alone after the British departed. Therefore, India’s control over the Northeast is a continuation of British colonialism.

In contrast, China maintained suzerainty over Tibet across multiple dynasties. Even after Tibet transitioned into a Buddhist theocracy, its ties with China were never fully severed. The Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas were appointed with the counsel of the Chinese emperor."

Specially landlock Mountains..

You have mainly Tourism as a source of income ..

Take bhutan for instance. 
You have to reliance from Lpg. To internet . To airport to everything to exist in today's world.. 

We need the very basic things to survive. Like
Internet
Lpg gas for cooking
University for higher studies
Embassy for visas
Border control to safe guard your country 
Airport to move out to the world 
Petrol/diesel/ cng for car 

All daily stuff from mobile to everything you need to import with your neighbour only. 

It's easy to say that I want a independent country 

But not PHYSICALLY EASY TO SURVIVE. .

Its my personal opinion"

The migration of the ancestors of north-east Indians and many other Tibeto-Burman ethnic groups in China, and Myanmar began around 3000 as a wave of Neolithic expansion.

Tibetan are descended of the same yellow river farmers as Han Chinese with some degree admixture with Palaeolithic tribes already present in Tibet. China maintained both genetic, linguistic and cultural ties with Tibet spanning numerous Chinese dynasties."

Hawaii and California are part of USA because they conquered it from natives. Siberia is part of Russia because they conquered it.

Heck it’s still a valid concept considering how Crimea was annexed by Russia recently. Or further back, Goa by India.

Moreover some states have too much seats in parliament they can easily gang up on smaller states like NE Ladakh Goa etc.  Yes I know it's delimitation and population based representation but that's not equality that's called proportionality.

And it's not like everyone should get independent or whatever. According to me whoever feel aligned has the right to stay. Otherwise British also could have given the same justification they could also say in their accent that if India gets independence then South Africa as well Oceania as well..

Manipur signed merger agreement in coercion with the then Indian leadership during independence, Tripura invaded by Bangladeshi Hindus and took over the political power from the indigenous, alienation from the central government towards NE (recent eg being Union budget was given to Bihar basically🤡, there are countless examples), blatant racism towards NE with no consequences and accountability thereafter, seeing us some kind of lower class people you can order around(false sense of superiority complex), Assam's CM basically looks like a bengali(He's not even a Tai Ahom or or Kachari or Bodo or from any among the major indigenous communities/tribes), NE has so less seats in the Parliament (LS and RS), etc.

If you are talking about script then it's part of Sino-Tibetan language family, if you think it borrows from Sanskrit then what language doesn't borrow, because the language itself borrows from Arabic & ancient Chinese etc.  by your language are ancient Assyrians the lords of proto-indosphere? If india borrows technology from West that doesn't make it subservient to West, does it?

Talking about culture, Uttrakhandi culture is not similar to Kerala yet you can't say or force people to say the culture is the same, the language is the same, the gods are all same. By that same logic we can say Indians practice ancient Pakistani culture, as most of the current sites of ancient Indus valley civilisation lie in modern pakistan. This is a disingenuous claim.

A country cannot claim faith & religion, india is fairly a new concept and a new country with its territorial boundaries, that was imposed by the British, the ancient Indian subcontinent as recorded by Indian as well greek scholars tell a diff story about it. Ancient people of the sub continent never called themselves as indians as such and never staked their claim. They never even migrated here as much as Tibetan migration to gilgit baltistan or sikkim etc. Buddhas birthplace is not in India and India is neither a Vajrayana Buddhist country, buddhism never flourished in India either, it came and went."

I was in Hong Kong just a month back, and if that’s how a “failing economy” is supposed to look like, then India’s should be classified as failed. Get out of your Reddit echo chambers for once and explore the world for yourself. For the past decade, I’ve been hearing about how China is close to a total economic collapse but guess what, they’re still standing strong. 

I used to be a unionist myself just a few years back. But over time I’ve seen how the babus in Delhi give negative fucks about us. Manipur is burning since god knows how long, China’s still building villages meters away from Arunachal border, Bangladeshis are diluting our demographics, and so much more. I used to be proud of being an Indian once but now I don’t care a bit. Why should I? The govt doesn’t think about us, the media is radio silent, and the people in mainland are fucking racists. 

Except Hyderabad and Kolkata, I’ve been either looked down upon, or have been called a Chinese/Korean/Chinki/Momo/etc in every single city that I’ve lived; be it Bangalore or Delhi or Mumbai. And you want me to be sympathetic and patriotic towards them? Pass"

I'm getting really tired of seeing what are supposed to be fellow believers in an ideology entirely dedicated to community welfare actively promoting behavior that not only does nothing to reduce harm while still being able to pursue other, more effective (at least in theory) forms of activism, but I believe is also partially responsible for the rapid acceleration of America's (probably inevitable) march towards fascism. It's not like you get kicked from the red club because you also voted. It's like people are using NOT voting as some form of faux praxis in an attempt to, I don't know, not feel guilty for most of our inability, or unwillingness (probably a mix of both for most) to change our personal way of life. This is coming from someone who's also one of those people almost definitely not doing as much as I can.

Thanks to people like you, the political discourse has shifted from social democracy versus conservative liberalism to moderate fascism versus full-blown fascism. By casting your vote from the position of ""just to keep the others out,"" you are doing a disservice to society. Not voting is a choice, a choice that denies your support to any of the outcomes. Now imagine if more than 50% of the population were to do the same—then there could be no talk of the legitimacy of power.

It was likely closed for being off topic.   
  
That said, I acknowledge it's a difficult time in the US right now and we (including me) are overlooking many off topic posts, including this one. It's my belief that unity and the dissemination of information is vital during this time, so I am taking a much more lenient stance in regards to our rules on off topic content. Honestly, we've always been this way - if we miss something that's off topic but it generates a lot of discussion, we leave it alone. I'm just setting the standard a little lower than I ordinarily would. If it's a good discussion and not low effort, chances are somebody is going to let it slide.

I'm trusting you all to be adults about this though, and not fire off every political post that exists no matter how off topic just because I said we are lenient.

Secondly, you can't count on Reddit. Antiwork isn't bought, but Reddit certainly is - and its CEO admires Musk."

Most of us are not on ""Team Democrat."" In fact, I hate most Democratic politicians. But the simple fact is that Republican politicians almost universally destroy worker's rights. Just look at their policies and what they vote for and what they implement whenever they have the chance.

This isn't about teams. This is about siding with the people who are actually going to implement policies that help workers, and not implement policies that don't help the workers.

I didn't like Biden. I think he was mostly yet another status quo neoliberal. But the fact of the matter that the people in charge of the NLRB under him helped unions grow their power and thereby helped workers fight for their rights. Trump has already done his best to cripple the NLRB in a short time, again just look it up.

Again, not about teams. This isn't football. It's about policies that help average workers vs. policies that harm average workers."

Will the repairs be subsidized by the government or students?

And us alumi/adults struggling to pay debts... Wonderful. 

Trump recently said he would ""clean out"" Gaza. What a win. /s

The protests did nothing but:
1) make a lot of onlookers dislike the protestors
2) create a hospitable environment for antisemitism (whether you believe Israel=Jews or not is irellavent, you have to literally be living under a rock to not see the overlap of haters at the protests).
3) Associate the palestinian cause with violence. 
4) spread a misleading ideology among a younger generation
5) cost us a lot of money 

Why did the protestors destroy McGill? Why did they damage Concordia? How does this do anything but alienate people? 

300k$ at Concordia alone... What about McGill? The city itself?

Id say 300k is an acceptable cost-to-risk ratio for their decision to have students arredted before the damage even happened.

Not to mention that alot of the damage itself was done by agent provocateurs ans under cover cops

https://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/concordia-vandalized-after-demonstration
From the same publication:

""Around 50 demonstrators had gathered on De Maisonneuve Blvd. for an “impromptu demonstration,” according to SPVM spokesperson Jean-Pierre Brabant. He said the windows were broken using blunt objects like baseball bats and hammers.

Four arrests were made on the scene, police later identified the arrestees to be in their 20s. The demonstrators were released without charges conditional to the results of an ongoing investigation.""

They caught and released the 4 people they found because they theyre either not a real threst or their agents provocateur. Thats how protests are made to look illegitimate and worth of mass arrests. Learn your protest history."

The last place you go to escape violence is Israel. It's way more dangerous to be Jewish, Palestinian, or anything  in that part of the world than Canada. You're going to get a lot more tension between Arabs and Israelis in the streets of Israel than you will in Canada, and a much stronger likelihood of violence.

If anything, we should be welcoming Jews and Arabs coming from Israel looking to escape the escalating violence there. The violence between Jews and Arabs in Israel is way worse than a few broken windows and hurt feelings we have in Canada. They literally shoot at each other in Israel."

Not just any war, a war of extermination. Look at the rhetoric of even pro-palestine protestors here. ""We don't want no two states, we want all of '48"" and ""Destroy Zionism Now!"" and ""From the river to the sea"".

The message is clear. Gaza's government exists solely to slaughter every single jew in Israel. And that makes things like a tens of thousand dead in the pursuit of the destruction of Gaza's government very acceptable to me.


We know what it looks like when Israel wins the war. only 40k dead and 2.2 million Gazans still alive. We also know what happens when Palestine wins the war, as shown on October 7th where the palestinians had complete military control for 7-8 hours and thats 8 million slaughtered dead jews in a massacre that would make the holocaust look like a pale comparison. Theres no comparison here.


Gaza set the stage, the rules, and the scope of the conflict. But they didn't get to set the ending of it, the Israelis made sure of that."

If anything, they did our discourse a disservice by too often taking Hamas' body count at face value. And wasn't part of the point of the protests to raise awareness? Is this an admission that you failed? 

Rubble is not genocide. Even civilian deaths is not genocide. Civilians die in every war. 500k German civilians died in WWII, no one calls that a genocide because that's what happens in war. And when the population of Gaza has increased since the war due to child births... what are we really talking about? There is no genocide. There is a brutal war initiated when Hamas decided in indiscriminately rape and slaughter a bunch of innocent people. Now, sadly, the population oppressed by the Hamas-led ""government"" pays the price."

**Al Chabaab**

*Bien qu’il soit principalement actif en Somalie, Al Chabaab a mené des attaques massives contre des civils et des forces militaires dans des pays considérés comme hostiles par le groupe, notamment le Kenya et l’Éthiopie, au cours des deux dernières décennies.*

**Al-Jamaa al-islamiya (AJAI)**

*Dans ses attentats, AJAI prenait principalement pour cible les policiers et les fonctionnaires, les informateurs et les sympathisants du gouvernement ainsi que les touristes étrangers et les coptes. AJAI a revendiqué l’attentat à la bombe de février 1993 dans un café au Caire, faisant au moins 3 morts et 15 blessés, dont un Canadien. AJAI a aussi tué 58 touristes étrangers et 4 Égyptiens à Louxor, en Égypte, en novembre 1997.*

**Al-Mourabitoune**

*a perpétré un acte terroriste : le 8 février 2014, il a enlevé cinq travailleurs humanitaires maliens près de Gao au Mali.*

These are just snippets from the first 3 on the list. The list goes on and on like this. So far, this all seems pretty legitimate terroristic activities to me.

""nuff said. Nobody sane moves into a war zone. Again, Hamas isn't firing rockets into Cote-Saint-Luc. 

We need to open the door to these people. Canada can be a safe haven for them. They're  well educated, integrate well, and help swell the ranks of the Jewish population in Canada. Canada should always be a safe haven for Jews fleeing violence and war. We need to keep open TFW's to Israeli citizens so they can continue to come here easily.

Also, keep in mind that that Netanyahu  is spreading propagandas exaggerating anti-semitism in Canada and the rest of the world because he's try to stem the mass outmigration from Israel. Don't let him scare you. You're safer here than there. Don't give in to his hysteria."

A horrible war was started by Hamas whose main strategy was to put as many civilians in harms way as possible. Hamas pursued a course of action that they knew would lead to thousands of civilians dying (due to them violating the Geneva convention and hiding millitary infra within civilian neighborhoods). Hamas, who started that war, made sure children died in that war, and sabotaged peace talks that could have stopped the war. War is horrific and civilians die in dense urban combat. It is the responsibility of the leadership (in this case, Hamas), to provide and protect for their people. However, Hamas did not protect them, build shelters for them, and they made sure as many of them died on purpose. Hamas does not value human life, Palestinian, or Israeli."

> La responsabilité d’une guerre incombe au belligérant, c’est comme ça que ça marche.

Meme advenant que Gaza est un etat capable de se battre de maniere egal, ceci est une sur-simplification des lois internationales de conflit. 

Oui, les etats ont un droit de se DEFENDRE. Cependant, massacrer des civils sans defense, causer des famines, limiter l'acces a des ressources vital ne sont PAS des mode de defense, c'est des crimes de guerre.

[Si tu lis cette article, par exemple, tu constatera que plusieurs des lois internationales lister ont deja ete briser par Israel.](https://www.cfr.org/article/what-international-law-has-say-about-israel-hamas-war). Israel a causer des famines, les conditions pour l'utilisation de force ne sont pas respecter et il y a une disproportionalite majeure de la reponse. 

>  L’Allemagne nazie est responsable des civils allemands morts pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, parce qu’elle a déclenché la guerre. 

Tu n'aurais pas pu choisir pire exemple pour supporter ton point. 

- Les nazis ont regrouper des millions de personnes dans des camps de concentration pour les abattre de maniere systematique. Qui fait cela, dans ce conflit? L'Israel est le groupe qui a confiner les Palestiniens (comme toi meme tu as mentioner). 
- Les civil Allemand non-nazi avait l'option de fuir le pays et le conflit. Ce n'est pas une option ici, Israel bombarde sans discriminer les civil. Qui plus est, la FDI a bombarder des zones SPECIFIQUEMENT SECURITAIRE. Ils ont annoncer des zones de securite, ou on fuit des civils, ET ILS LES ONT BOMBARDER. 
- Les nazis ont entamer un conflit pour assurer leur Lebensraum et la dominance de leur race ethnique. C'est ce que fait Israel en ce moment. L'Hamas n'est pas un monolithe, mais ma comprehension baser sur plusieurs sources d'information c'est que les Palestiniens etaient disposer a accepter un deal tres genereux, ou ils conserve ~20% de leurs territoire et East Jerusalem comme capitale. C'est les Zionistes qui refuse de limiter leurs expansion dans ce conflit, la ligue Arabe a fait la meme offre a plusieurs reprise et Israel trouve toujours des raisons de refuser. 

D'ailleurs, constate le vol de territoire qu'Israel commet en Syrie. Encore une fois, tu as choisi un terrible exemple. C'est absurde de comparer la machine de guerre allemande de la deuxieme guerre mondiale aux Hamas. Israel est le groupe en position d'oppreseur qui occupe illegalement un territoire ([source](https://www.ft.com/content/6a60da92-5795-46c6-9175-2f425d3805d0), pour n'en citer qu'une seule). Un envahisseur n'a pas de droits, il n'a que l'obligation de cesser l'occupation illegale du territoire."

Tes accusations de famine et génocides manquent de preuves : https://www.inss.org.il/publication/un-hunger-reports/.

C’est aussi drole que tu dis qu’Israel est une société ethnonationaliste quand c’est 20% arabe/musulmane tandis que le Gaza est probablement à 99% arabe musulmane. Le Hamas a à plusieurs reprises nuit aux accords, préférant de vivre comme des oligarches mercenaires qui exploitent et qui tuent les palestiniens. La montée de Netanyahu n’a qu’empiré la situation :https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/timeline-israeli-palestinian-peace-process-1993-oslo-accord/.

C’est ironique comment tu traites les Israeliens comme des êtres monolitiques colonisateurs, surtout considérant qu’une petite minorité comment des actes de violence en Cisjordanie. Tu fais de la projection solide. Considérant que ce sont tes propers ancêtres qui sont probablement des envahisseurs, pourquoi n’as-tu pas encore donné ta maison, ton argent et ton héritage à des Autochtones. Et pourquoi es-tu encore à Montréal/Turtle Island? 

En gros, une guerre horrible a été déclenchée par le Hamas dont la stratégie principale était de mettre en danger le plus grand nombre possible de civils. Le Hamas a savait qu’il entraînerait la mort de beaucoup de civils (en raison de leur disissimulation d’infra militaires dans des quartiers civils).  La guerre est horrible et des civils meurent dans des combats urbains intenses. Il est de la responsabilité des dirigeants (dans ce cas, le Hamas) de subvenir aux besoins de leur peuple et de le protéger. Cependant, le Hamas ne les a pas protégés, n’a pas construit d’abris pour eux et a fait en sorte que beaucoup d’entre eux meurent volontairement. Le Hamas n’accorde aucune valeur à la vie humaine, qu’elle soit palestinienne ou israélienne. C’est pourquoi je blame principalement le Hamas pour cette guerre atroce."

post,LSAT Cheating Services Are Exploding,Ok_Strike_7815,500,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/1ieygr2/lsat_cheating_services_are_exploding/,2025-02-01 04:31:13+00:00,117.0,LSAT,"https://preview.redd.it/gj9s2yn2umge1.jpg?width=2244&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26ea949c16243c21a65ec7ae8a31d022c1513c21

I recently stumbled upon something that honestly makes me sick. I’m Chinese, and I’ve been seeing more and more posts on Rednote with LSAT applicants boasting 175+ scores. At first, I thought that's impressive. But then I started noticing something off—an increasing number of *替考* (proxy test-taking) and *技术服务* (technical assistance) offers flooding the Rednote.

So, I did some digging. I googled Chinese keywords like LSAT test assistance, and what I found was shocking. There are entire businesses openly advertising LSAT cheating services—whether it’s hiring a proxy to take the test, exploiting remote testing loopholes, or using technology to manipulate results. This is not just an isolated scam—it’s a full-on industry.

This isn’t just unfair—it’s turning the LSAT into a money game where the wealthiest students can buy their way in while hardworking, honest applicants are left at a disadvantage.

I’m planning to gather more evidence by engaging with these services and will also be writing to LSAC to report this, but I know one voice isn’t enough. We need more people to pressure LSAC to acknowledge and address this issue. Ideally, every past client of these services should be investigated.

As a Chinese, I’m disgusted by this situation. It damages the integrity of the exam and ultimately harms my fellow Chinese applicants in both the short and long term. It also reinforces negative stereotypes.

Of course, I don’t want anyone seeing these links to be tempted to take shortcuts. I’m committed to exposing this issue and will keep posting updates until all these links are taken down and LSAC provides a clear response and investigation.

I also don't think we should comfort ourselves by thinking they'll struggle in law school studying and won’t survive—many can still get into T14, land in the bottom 30%, and still reap the benefits of the prestige.

Update 1: As this issue has drawn more attention and concern, I decided to remove the links and Chinese keywords upon further consideration. My initial intention was to raise awareness and encourage others to report this alongside me. Since these services were primarily advertised in Chinese and connect on Wechat, I didn’t consider too much about the ads effect here. I apologize for any additional concern this may have caused within the community. I will provide another update once I receive a response from LSAC—if this post remains up."

It's just as possible those are scam services. There are only 1751's so far this cycle. Only 6719 Asians applied. The stats show the bell curve for Asians on the LSAT is regular and doesn't have a giant bulge at 175+. 

If, suddenly, 50% of 175+ scorers were Chinese, from China, it would be very very obviously and very very risky to have used such a service.

I never got an update on what happened, but I did get anonymously contacted by someone who claimed to have successfully paid for someone to take his test and got him a high LSAT score. He wanted to know if he would be at a competitive disadvantage in law school. I told him that if he is ever caught he could be disbarred and have wasted tens or hundreds of thousands on a useless degree and that the only way to avoid that for sure would be to turn himself in now. I then informed LSAC and gave them his throwaway reddit account and phone number."

Please don’t let this discourage you from studying hard—this is a difficult process, and determination matters a lot.

From what I’ve heard, the situation was worse two or three years ago. I believe the number of Chinese students using these services might not be as high as some fear. At least, LSAC’s official statistics don’t indicate significant irregularities. I’m also glad to see more Chinese students stand out sharing their knowledge about this in the comments.

I hesitated before posting this because the last thing I want is for my fellow Chinese students to be looked down upon—especially those who are genuinely putting in the effort. As someone who plans to study at a U.S. law school in the future, this issue is particularly concerning to me.

Updates:
1.	I previously tried reporting the account above on RedNote, but my report was ignored as they claimed there was no suspicious activity.(the account posts used just hinting language tho) It’s ironic how quickly they censor speech but ignore this issue.

2.	I scanned several WeChat QR codes listed on the website and made some inquiries. They require a deposit ranging from $700 to half of the total cost, some of the cost is around $7000 or above. Because of the deposit, I couldn’t investigate further to determine whether it’s a scam or a real service. One of the reasons I’m posting this is to raise awareness, hoping that officials or journalists might step in to investigate, even if its just a scam.

3.	They claim to have special browser plugins that allow remote technical assistance without detection and even offer to set it up for you. I will save the chat history screenshots and send them to LSAC, though based on what I’ve seen with ETS, I don’t have much confidence in how exam bureaucracies handle these issues."

Whether you’re on the left or the right or in the middle, everyone can point to instances where the US government engaged in utterly corrupt behavior against its own citizens. 

Now imagine what the CCP (Communist Chinese Party) thinks about all of this. Does anyone really think that the CCP will somehow be more benevolent towards the US than its own government? 

My point: this is far more entrenched than people might imagine. This is the kind of stuff that needs to be communicated to journalists. US politicians have much more “important” things to deal with. Quotations used to indicate sarcasm.

I made this account months ago to try and share this story, but it was too young for me to post. 

I'm intimately familiar with this industry because I worked with an Australian girl who had a Chinese boyfriend in the industry. He made, I shit you not, half a million USD taking tests for people. 

Thousands of Chinese students (often with the complicity of or at the prodding of their parents) paid him money to take TOEFL, IELTS, Duolingo, GMAT, GRE, LSAT, you name it. Different people would do different parts of the tests. He would do the English sections and then give a fee to a math guy who would take over the quant sections. When the LSAT still had logic games, people would click through the tests quickly and take pictures of each game before going back to the first one. They'd split the games among different test takers and then take pics of the hardest logical reasoning questions for one person to work on while someone else did the easy ones. 

I know about this because he showed me and then tried to get me to recruit the kids I was tutoring at the time (I was working in China but not teaching at a school). I told him I wasn't going to screw them over educationally by having them cheat, but by this point I'd pretty much seen it all. The way it works is that the cheaters get software installed on their computer beforehand that's undetectable by the testing software. Then, someone else either controls the computer or just watches it and feeds them answers through a cell phone taped to the screen. People aren't hacking into test databases for answers; for tough tests like LSAT, either they have one or two really smart people who can do it all or they split up the question between several test takers. 

A massive cohort of Chinese students have unfortunately cheated their way to an undeserved high score on tests like these, and the testing companies don't seem to give a shit (I tried to share this issue with ETS and IELTS and they basically blew me off). If they catch the cheaters, they cancel their score, but then they can pay to take the test again without a black mark on their record. It seems these companies care more about raking in the cash of would-be international students than they do about stopping cheating. 

The cheating doesn't stop at test-taking either. They pay to have their personal statements written, to take someone feed them answers during interviews, etc. 

I wish there were some way to put a stop to this but I don't think it will happen without more scrutiny on one specific ethnic group by schools and that seems... impossible and unethical."

Yes, there are some services like that. They charge a lot (at least USD 5000) for getting a high score (170+). I feel very upset when I found that there actually are huge numbers of test taker using the service for cheating and they got 170 or 175. Sometimes they pay more for 180. They also have customized service if you want a specific score like 167, 168. I’ve noticed some law school students from T20 posted that they found their classmates cheated on the LSAT and their class performance was really poor in 1L. People tried to contact LSAC and complain about this but they didn’t get response. These service providers have the list of their customers. I hope that LSAC takes the issue seriously."

Um I also am encountering major issues with ProProctor. (Multiple Instancing).

Basically, I suspect the Technical Services Clause we click through about Remote Access Technical Support is a lie. 

(The chatbot / support team said that they cannot help you via remote access).

Prometric Customer Service line ONLY deals with registrations, and when I got transfered to a ""Technical Service"" Line I got a voicemail saying the technical service line ended in April & to use the ehelp website. It then hangs up on you.

The website doesn't make a lot of sense when you have a proctor application that cuts off access to your internet. 

I am not bringing this up to be vindictive or litigious, but I think LSAC needs to know that the representations Prometric  is making about technical support is not accurate.

EDIT: I should probably make a separate post on this, but my family is in the Federal Government and I am trying to help them navigate this ""period"" we are going through.

But the larger risk is that the scheme will succeed at first, but then eventually unravel. The person may pay tens of thousands of dollars and invest years of their life only to be found out and never be able to be admitted to the bar or be debarred."

Read my comment below - I've seen the results of this myself. According to the guy I know who worked for these companies, the only 'scam' part of the services is the promise of 175+ - plenty of cheaters pay and get back a score between 165 and 175. The test taking service will then say take it or leave it, threatening to cancel the student's score if they don't pay. 90% of the time the kids will just pay up and keep the lower score, but they will still have gotten a 90th percentile + score illicitly."

In fact, I believe that such “honey pots” are a very real thing.

Unquestionably, it’s far less risky to try to rip off an individual than it is to commit wire fraud. I mean, what’s the individual gonna do? Call the FBI and say they were ripped off in a criminal conspiracy? 

But China is an entirely different ball game. Undoubtedly, these services operate with the blessing of the CCP. 

Put it this way: can’t take the LSAT any longer in India. The LSAC has some weird justification for doing this, but everyone knows that it’s because cheating is rampant in India.

Unfortunately, too many US businesses are dependent on China. Not just for the resources, but for the customer base. 

Everyone knows the CCP is a very bad thing for the western world, but currently, there’s only one loudmouth in the US willing to call out their bullshit."

Most of them have legitimate, verified reviews from customers that are vetted by these sites. Since cheating on foreign test (not Chinese ones) is not technically illegal under Chinese law, the government does nothing to stop the business from operating. In other words, prospective cheaters have good reason to believe that they will actually get the results they pay for. In most cases they do."

I’m sorry but a person needs to have a fairly sophisticated fluency in English to comfortably understand LSAT passages. I say that as someone who has grown up in an English-speaking country my entire life and still googles the meaning of words. And I’m almost middle aged.

This argument requires the assumption that LSAC hasn’t been compromised in a way where their answer bank isn’t simply hacked into. Or that high-scoring LSAT test takers who are fluent in English aren’t simply working with providers like these. Or that LSAC doesn’t have a mole. Or that these aren’t honeypots that were planted by LSAC."

My wife is a realtor and she had to pay for a some dumb course and a bunch of tests to become a realtor. The course she took had absolutely nothing to do with being a realtor. There was law related information and a lot of lending. None of which was relevant. Almost 4K to start she has never used any of the information learned. 

My point is, money is the driving force to keep the lsat relevant or any test of that matter. Fees everywhere. Humans will find ways to manipulate the system because we are corrupt beings."

With regard to LSAT specifically, the most common outcome is that the score that is promised is not reached because even the best test takers can't consistently churn out 170+ results. Fortunately, cheaters are likely to continue to cheat throughout the entire process, paying for PS's, fake recommendations, etc., and if they take that same mindset to law school they'll likely either flunk out or get caught trying to cheat on a take-home exam. 

That leaves us with a massive problem, though, because these kids will be taking the spots of people who grinded their way through the process by themselves."

I'm more for community support and physical mutual aid networks to survive this, rather than wasting resource on people who still want to prop up 'good guy millionaires', preach electoralism, hold signs and do all of this bullshit that may still have had the illusion of purpose in 2019.

I think the reality is that most Americans are multi generationally atomized, and this was done on purpose. In that case, most of us were fucked the moment we were born. We're displaying the same malaise to events that are going to lead to mass starvation, and the propaganda machine has already ensconced itself to program workerbees to avoid anyone who falls through the cracks or to turn them into ~~soylent green~~, ~~traffickers~~, the authorities.

TBH, I don't think there is an underground anymore. But when one in five knows someone who's disappeared and no one around them knows why, and it really starts to hit home that there's nothing left to lose, you'll start seeing it again."

We made this country before any of the comforts of the communication technology we use were even conceived. Get off your phones and print fliers go to libraries and parks actually converse with people. Communicate directly and not through phones or mail or technology.

Start with friends. Do as much as you can in real life. Discuss nothing of real importance on the phone, texts or email. You can't hack hard copy so notes, flyers and zines are useful. Find community centers and churches that will let you meet in their basements and such. Pick one thing you can be consistently reliable about whether it's making sandwiches, providing transportation for those that need it, whatever. Consistency over time matters. Be honest about what works and what doesn't as far as moving your adopted needle. Read and learn from the black revolutionaries that have come before. Learn what failed, why and what the consequences were. Look to other countries for ideas and inspiration where applicable. Most important just start talking to people. Start in your niche; comic shops, dnd clubs, farmers markets, gaming, whatever. Make connections with others that are willing to act at least as much as they talk. Preferably more. Seek out your nearest John Brown Gun Club. If you don't have one locally reach out to the nearest and ask if they can provide you with materials to start your own. And watch each other's asses. ✊️👊🍻"

Every morning this week (and possibly ongoing) - OPM building

Bodies, cameras

Signal recommended for communications

For updates - @taliajane.bsky.social  @chadloder.bsky.social @marisakabas.bsky.social (broke important stories on this coup recently)

""Shutdown DC"" also, but I am not confident yet of the accurate socials for that group - be careful
@AOC may post some developments too, depends where her energy is most needed

SPREAD IT. 
In your own communities, there are likely to be town halls and local protests for many different purposes, good to see people showing up already - big one in Los Angeles

I'll post again if I see some useful hashtags or other organising spaces coalescing

In view of recent developments and Musk weaponising law apparatus and more far faster and worse than I ever imagined, I've been struggling to think of what to say now, especially with knowledge that many people here are quite everyday normie citizens and likely also quite young.

 Please just be aware that the risks and costs of many things you might do are likely far, far higher than the context we have had at earlier times in our lifetime such as 2015-2020, and even than I had expectation or knowledge of when I wrote my posts. These people are true accelerationists in many many senses of that concept, with everything to gain, no other offramp, playing for keeps, hidden billionaire bunkers, private economic zones, weapons companies, ""network states"" allied with them, and cult-like sort of apocalypsey beliefs (you can research TESCREAL) as well as megalomania messianic level thinking mixed with drug-addled reasoning and boldness. For more on that I recommend the work of Gil Duran and this website compiled by tech workers over a decade dealing with these people, while they all pretended to be things they are not and hoodwinked so many. https://www.vcinfodocs.com/venture-capital-extremism

At this time (as in, the next couple of weeks) I doubt any great danger or risk in attending  very peaceful actions in larger groups of normie citizens, during the daytime, organised and attended by highly mainstream groups such as Indivisible and MoveOn , which is for example the Tuesday 5pm one.
Local things, I do not know. When protesting or direct-actioning, never leave the main group and separate into a smaller group.

 Unless you are a long, long,  seasoned and basically 'professional' antifascist/protester with enormous firsthand and seasoned knowledge and experience of the relevant law, safety lore, long long established networks with that knowledge that can help you, (and this kind of knowledge or experience you may find or use may also simply be inaccurate and out of date now, in the current new circumstances), I would really be cautious and take a good amount of consideration if new to this, about many other actions where you can be identified in person or intercepted by authorities (or others). Please also research things like 'fedposting' and take advice, cautions, and knowledge from I would recommend @chadloder.bsky.social.  Some recent cautions written there and I would recommend as a general resource. And just see how things develop. I recommend that person highly for all of the above. I recommend @shayan86.bsky.social about disinformation/false information. Also Snopes and PolitiFact. Watch who all these people trust and repost and who they don't.


I can't tell anyone what they should do or what they feel called to do, only that the risks and costs may be far, far different to the context available when I first wrote my posts, especially for somewhat beginners and young people. Because of that I felt a responsibility to alert about this change of context and feel free to circulate this post while being clear you are not discouraging resistance. For younger people and beginners especially, boycotts and de-consumption talk and many other things are a very very low-risk avenue and it's fantastic to see that. 

I know this isn't what we all want to hear and my knowledge and experience level isn't enough to say more about where else to go from here at this time. I'm sorry and I am just saying these things in an abundance of caution since I previously recommended action to normies. Stay connected and learn and research, I guess that would be my 'totally safe' suggestion, and chatting to each other using Signal. Recommend anyone interested in all of these things have and use Signal, and encouraging those you care about to get it is also a great idea. I am hoping the rest of the world is making plans and contingencies about the situation and I'll do everything I can from my much safer part of the world in that way. I don't know what to expect or hope for, but it's quite possible it could look like nothing is happening, until it does happen

Hugs"

Many already have some kind of activism built in (race and social justice groups and the like). Many (at least in my area) are also welcoming to people regardless of where they are on their personal spiritual journey (none of that ""you have to believe exactly what we do"" nonsense). We saw Bishop Budde at the inauguration. Anyway, I'm sure there are other churches doing great stuff. But personal experience if you're considering churches as a gathering place, they tend to be a real one."

According to some other ex military I've been watching, there is like a 40/60 divide in the military (antifa/fa)...and despite stale left media grifting that we peasants just need to trust rich kids waxing left rhetoric to tell us how to be poor, veterans are historically the ones most inclined to praxis. More religious folks are being shaken out of complacency too.

Don't get me wrong. A lot of people are going to die before the masses realize they outnumber the problem. If you consider COVID and homeless policies of the last 20 years, a lot people already have...but when atrocity moves up the food chain a little too quickly, something somewhere gets sparked.

Also: I'm not a hundred percent on board with the Defense of Democracy in terms of demonstrations. I think stealth education and stealth supply chain networks are where the need is at this juncture."

Conservative communist parties appearing in Europe is to be expected. A lot of people who have been drawn to the alt-right by their conservative messages against feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration and the likes still despise capitalism enough to reject parties like AfD that embrace it. BSW is the first big party in Western Europe of its kind, but it will (sadly) not be the last.

I guess we'll spend the next decade or two explaining zoomers why authoritarian ""radical"" governments are not a good idea."

Their domestic enforcement arm (the cops) serve this rotten system, so in that sense, you could say all cops are bad because they help to enforce a rotten, plutocratic (anti-working class) system.


But not every single cop is morally evil on an individual level (apart from participating, possibly unwittingly, in their function as enforcers for plutocracy), and if you encounter a violent criminal or dangerous situation, a cop might still end up saving you from being maimed or killed while putting their own life on the line.

I hate American policing, but I work in social services and sometimes we need to rely on the police to help with mentally ill people in crisis. It can be a tossup, but I had the benefit of having a calm, reasonable, collected cop sent in a recent crisis case. Person in question was understandably belligerent as their rights were being temporarily taken away, but the cops were professional, graceful to the person, and only used a proportionate amount of force to keep the person subdued. It made me, for a second, want to believe in the possibility of there being 'Good Cops'.

Of course, I later searched up the cop's badge number and precinct and saw he had numerous complaints including 1 substantiated one. Which sucks. But in the narrow frame of my own direct experience, I couldn’t have asked him to do better. So what do you do with that? How do you hold both of those things in your head at the same time? The knowledge that the system is irredeemably broken, and the recognition that, at the granular level of individual human behavior, sometimes even the agents of that system get it right?"

The Chinese government *and* the American government are corrupt as hell and want your data for their purposes, not yours.

The major tech industries in both countries bend the knee to these governments and exploit the power and influence they amass for their own benefits, not ours.

So don't feel the need to choose a ""side"" when neither of them respects or values you. Recognize the futility of attempting to assign value or significance to your choices, because there is a massive effort on both sides to pull people one way or the other.

Only partially. You're high if you think every tech CEO has the same sway someone like Musk does. Zuckerberg threw a ton of money at Trump, and in the end he is still going to have to compete with TikTok.

An oligarchy does not mean these businesses get the final say of everything the government does. They're just in on the game.

>This is a defeatist attitude a symptom of alienation. 

I'd encourage you to reflect on your arrogance. It seems awfully obvious I'm talking about consumers on an individual level.

But more than that, you don't even know what you mean when you say ""organization"". This isn't something you can boycott. The only degree of organization that matters here is having a government that actually regulates and holds businesses accountable for their actions.

Nothing less will create meaningful change. 

That's not defeatist. That's reality. If you feel defeated hearing that, then own that shit for yourself."

While that is better than most existing models such as the terribly named open AI which is not open at all, it's still possible to poison results on the data side.  Also. Like anything funded by the PRC all data entered into the system will be shared directly to the government with identifying information.  There is no separation between government and companies in China.  Any corporate data would also go into those databases and be given to competing companies in China.


As far as running the code on a local system I don't see why that would be problematic, but that's not what most people are going to use.

in terms of other chinese data, the problem there is the chinese government can basically seize any data they want from any chinese company. They have no recourse to stop them, nor do they have any duty to report it.

So basically, poor privacy practices, unapologetic biases, plus authoritarian regimes who have vested interests in destabilising other countries.

The risk is severe enough that Google opted to withdraw from a 1.4 billion person market. They would not have done that lightly. 

China is the largest stealer of intellectual property in the world. Promptibg  US presidential debates to dedicate 5-10 minutes of limit airtime just to discussing enforcing patent law against China. 

China has never successfully built a working  aircraft carrier but ""somehow"" in parallel to the US is coming out with their own nuclear powered carriers with electromagnet catapults. They paused construction because the US found a design flaw and China is waiting for us to fix it so they can steal the solution as well. (This was open source a few years ago, I might be behind now). 

In addition to espionage, China utilizes US data breaches to identify Chinese party defectors in the US and the imprisons their family back home in work camps with low survival rates. This was a big reason for googles ethical concern. 

China is also known to intercept and impound shipments of respectable US branded goods like Cisco so they can physically tamper with the firmware. High end US companies track their hardware shipments for unscheduled China diversions and will not use that hardware if suspected. 

But sure by all means, give them root access to your network."

The big reason to suppress the fear or not make it a big to do is/was money. 

Some people may disagree and downvote me, but because Trump has spoke of China and highlighted the threat ad nauseam since 2016, I think the overall stance is the ol idiom, ""Let the cat out of the bag"" and we have accepted whatever consequences that will come and the fact that we can no longer ignore or appease them.

The problem is we have let it go for too long without taking it seriously and now we are scrambling to course correct.  Something the government is notorious for.   They have scooped up so much of our information, market and actual land in our country that all can be done is go back at them and use their methods against them.

All apps leak data. Some leak much more than others. 

I got into doing this after catching phone home signals from Chinese made internet connected products: Security Cameras, home routers etc. 

If I had a $100k to spend on an IMSI catcher I would track the cell connection to see if apps behaved differently with cell service. 

The tldr is: remove all social media apps from your phone. They all leak, Chinese apps generally are demonstrably more malicious than their Western counterparts.

The only difference is that in addition to those concerns when it comes to China -- because of their laws -- there are also geopolitical concerns (understanding societal vulnerabilities, influencing public opinion, and running propaganda campaigns), espionage (identifying and tracking individuals in sensitive positions in business/government), and strategic leverage (collecting data on industries, infrastructure, and technology to gain economic or military advantages.)   
  
At least 4 different Chinese laws I'm aware of (NSL of 2015, National Intelligence Law of 2015, Cybersecurity Law of 2017, Counter-Espionage Law of 2023) require total compliance and assistance to be provided to law enforcement or intelligence agencies upon request, without any court orders required or oversight. This applies to private companies as well as foreign companies operating in China.

There is no way to legally require a US company to assist like that without due process and involving the judicial branch."

The data is now stored by telecom companies and accessible only by court order to the NSA. Do I think the NSA just gathers the data they need other ways, such as using fingerprinting techniques? Absolutely. Do I think they are gathering 100% of all US data like they used to? I doubt it, but neither of us can say for sure unless you have the proper security clearances and are willing to break the law to talk about it. Do I trust the NSA? No. Do I trust the US government? No.

In addition, after the Snowden leaks, there has been increased oversight from Congress and judicial bodies (HPSCI, SSCI). The USA Freedom Act also created independent amicus curiae to provide legal expertise and advocate for privacy and civil liberties before FISC. Does this mean the system is perfect? No. Is FISA probably largely a rubber stamp if the surveillance is targeting a foreign target and the government is claiming national security concerns? Yes. FISC also [started publishing declassified opinions](https://www.intelligence.gov/ic-on-the-record-database/results/1259-release-of-two-fisc-decisions-authorizing-novel-intelligence-collection), providing more insight into its rulings and interpretations. Is this a full accounting of its ruling and interpretations? No.

Before Trump fired them all, Inspector Generals across the IC world started conducting deeper audits of surveillance activities. Is this something we as the public get to see and have access to their investigations and results? No. We've already established I don't trust the government in general, but do I think everything the government does is not trustworthy and that everyone working for the government as an inspector general is not trustworthy? Not necessarily. They have released reports to the public and Congress about the scope and compliance of surveillance programs over the last \~15 years.

ODNI also started publishing [Statistical Transparency Reports](https://www.odni.gov/index.php/newsroom/reports-publications/reports-publications-2023/3688-statistical-transparency-report-regarding-national-security-authorities-calendar-year-2022) that provide information about the number of targets under various authorities such as Section 702 and NSLs. In addition, the permanent gag orders from NSLs were removed and require periodic judicial review of the orders when issued.

It isn't news to me that the US government has -- and has always -- been one of the most sophisticated countries when it comes to espionage and signals intelligence. I've read a majority of James Bamford's books (and countless others) so I'm well aware. Am I supposed to NOT want my country to be dominant in this area? I'm not aware of any major power that willingly chooses to not collect all the signals intelligence they can if they have the capability. I don't think a single country has the necessary capability and doesn't use it. But US companies aren't required to cooperate with CIA spying operations in foreign countries without court orders and judicial branch involvement, as well as being able to fight those orders in court which US companies have regularly done such as Apple and Microsoft. 

I don't blindly support everything my country does, but I do love my country and would prefer it to remain the dominant superpower. If that makes me a bad person, then I'm comfortable with that."

2. Move to Russia and enjoy a nice retirement in a safe country.

The middle class is dead, dead, dead. 

Give me one good reason why I should stay in America---even though in 20 years from now when I should be retiring--I will have to work until I drop dead. 

Look at the rate of inflation. Look at the high cost of living. Look at the unaffordable healthcare.

And you say this is ""unhinged"" ??

If you haven't noticed, people in this country are kinda sorta pissed the fuck off that houses are unaffordable and the ever-increasing cost of living means they won't be able to retire."

They could continue to use the vulnerability until such time as the organisation patches it. They also can exploit any international vulnerabilities they discover without the need to disclose (maybe with the exception of close allies)

Note: I still think they should follow any ethical and legal requirements they currently do on top of my suggestions"

You're from the generation that let the AMA limit the number of new doctors, and pushed for government intervention in health insurance, increasing healthcare costs to unbelievably high level...

I asked this question of the CISA second in command at an ISC2 Secure conference back in... I think Fall 2023?

Yes, there's warring motives, but there's a system in which if a zero day is based on a US- or ally-owned company, they typically get disclosed; others will, as the public interest outweighs the security interest. 

Not perfect -- and only as good as the ethical people within that agency -- but that system already exists."

I really like your composition, it feels very whimsical. I especially love pics 5, 8, 10, and 12. I think your use of color is nice as well but if you want to be more mindful of the colors think about the color wheel and what colors compliment and contrast one another when picking the images you're working with.

Some things I do when trying to branch out is watch videos of other creators on YouTube and tik tok. It helps to see what else is possible beyond my limited scope and imagination. I def recommend checking out HwauFranc and Makizume Journal log on YT. I always watch their videos and feel inspired by what they do :)

Another thing you could try is to do something completely against type to break out of your usual patterns. I created one of my favorite pages when I challenged myself not to completely cover the page with stuff and leave more negative space. It could help you approach your journaling with a new set of eyes."

Just personally I like having a focal point that kind of cements the rest of the page. But I understand art is subjective and that’s just my personal preference!

Theres something called ""visual weight"" in graphic design, elements with higher visual weight are usually darker, or bigger. You can study this, but I think its lots of gut feeling but also being mindful

Plenty of collage people struggle with too many items that have similar visual weight, and sometimes thats the vibe (like image 9 and 11) but then you have layouts like 7 and 13 where you dont really know what to look at and everything is fighting for your attention and it ends up looking like a ""texture"" rather than a composition

But you do have an eye for this! I think 8 10 and 12 (and others) are very nicely composed, and thats why i said its a gut feeling at times. 

Some SPECIFIC tips i could give you are when you are looking at your cutouts choose 1 that you want it to be the center piece (it doest have to be in the actual center of the page just where the attention will be) and collage the background AROUND IT, you could choose 2 center pieces maybe, for a ""the creation of adam effect"" (like opossite forces or something). If you have a phrase, try placing it near the center image cause eyes are naturally drawn to text and we want to make the attention focused on one spot.

If all your trinkets have similar visual weights, putting a scrap of craft paper so something behind center pieces will make them pop (like a foreground Ig)

Or instead of having a single cut out being the center piece, make it a cluster of cut outs, like an ""arrangement"" of cut outs or a bouquet, and no matter where you place it on the page it will be the center piece cause it's has lots of elements and trinkets (that's usually the way I collage) 

HOPE THIS HELPS, my dms are open if you want more collag-y chat (for anyone 👁) and sorry for the rant"

Humor requires nuance, context, irony, etc. The ""West Taiwan"" comment is the closest thing to humor out of all them, because at least it's relevant to this being a milsim kit consisting of Chinese gear with a Taiwanese patch. Parroting ""Bing chilling"" and ""herro"" just because you see something Chinese is low effort, stupid racist nonsense."

She let us know there could be a chance that it’s just like his first term where the sue lasted 6 years and they were still able to process and renew TPS so I know it may seem like a moment of panic but and it is but we still have a chance. We can apply it to another I- whichever I-485 I-130 I-765 it will take time but it’s okay as long as you are waiting for a court date. I wish all the Venezuelas that are panicking at this moment the best and I send blessing and love their way this isn’t for me this was for my husband luckily we’ve been married already for a little over 2 years and were immediately starting his green card process we don’t rlly have the money for it but I am not risking the man I love for anything.

Yes, under current US immigration law, expedited removal is primarily used against individuals who have been present in the United States for less than two years; meaning if you can demonstrate you have been in the country for more than two years, you are generally not subject to expedited removal proceedings. 
Key points about expedited removal:
Two-year time limit:
The primary factor determining if someone can be subject to expedited removal is whether they can prove they have been in the US for less than two years. 
Limited appeal options:
Expedited removal typically offers very limited opportunities for appeal, making it a fast and often stringent process. 
Border proximity:
While the two-year presence is key, expedited removal is often applied to individuals apprehended near the US border. 


Do not create fear please; that is what they want; create fear and deception; more efficient than everything."

Why even advocate to normalize paying less to immigrants? If American jobs weren’t outsourced to poor countries and Americans had to work the jobs guess what? The jobs would be filled. If they companies continue to not pay on par with other American jobs then the position doesn’t get filled. The company goes broke. Companies need workers, therefor they will raise payment. It’s ludicrous to think the jobs won’t get filled. It’s also ludicrous to say that immigrants are important to take low paying jobs. You comment sounds a lot like that person from the view “who’s going to clean your toilets Donald trump”. It’s a sickening way of thinking."

And instead of responding to the request for evidence, instead he just refiled? It sounds to me he never re-registered correctly. 

But then you say he refilled and it was approved? What did the approval notice say? That should have validity dates on it, but if he refilled after the January 17 re-designation of this year, and that is what you were referring to as what was approved, then I would think that approval would been recently rescinded but it seems awfully soon for him to have received approval so quick. But I don’t see how he would’ve gotten the approval after January 17, if he never correctly refiled during the last re-registration window for the 2021 designation.

Please stop being ignorant and believing perpetuated lies. White Americans get less and lighter sentences for the same or worse crimes than black or non white Americans.

(Not federally, but state wise yes) If American companies didn’t hire people that aren’t legally supposed to work then there wouldn’t be the abuse of taking advantage of people that cannot work legally in America. Therefor it shouldn’t be advocated to allow illegals immigrants to work. My girlfriend is from Mexico and we’re in the process of figuring out our wedding and applying for her green card. When she comes to the US she’ll have the opportunity to work what ever job she wishes since she will be legal. Not having to find jobs that will hire her illegally. So from your own perspective you’re indirectly agreeing that illegal immigration has an effect on American wages and gives credence to companies to not increase wages. Because “the immigrants will just take the lower paying job”. So therefor if the illegal immigration problem gets fixed in America companies would be forced to hire legal workers and in turn would have to increase the pay. Or they can refuse to pay on par with other companies, lose their workers, and then have a failing company."

So news will be most likely bad things, since our brain accentuate the negative more. Hence rather than worrying about what you can't control, it's better focus on those that your arms could reach. 

Sebagai contoh: PPN naik. Is this something that you alone can change or control? Nope. 

Does being angry make it goes away? Nope. So what you could do? Does it affect your financial situation? How you going to manage the impact of it? Does you can do something to prevent it with other people? etc.

Basically yes, focus your limited time on earth on something that is within your ability to change. To know what is within your ability is what we called wisdom. To be able to change what within your ability is what we called strength/influence. To make the first step to create that change is what we called courage. To endure what is unchangeable is what we called patience.

>Katanya 80% rakyat puas sama pemerintah, itu sih cuma propaganda doang.

Wow... itu survei Kompas loh. Survei tersebut memang hanya mengambil 1000 responden, tapi kenapa? Karena survei yang penting representatif dengan demografi. Misal 10% penduduk Indonesia Kristen, yang surveinya harus ada 100 suara orang Kristen (100/1000 = 10%).

>One key question faced by Gallup statisticians: how many interviews does it take to provide an adequate cross-section of Americans? The answer is, not many -- that is, if the respondents to be interviewed are selected entirely at random, giving every adult American an equal probability of falling into the sample. The current U.S. adult population in the continental United States is 187 million. The typical sample size for a Gallup poll, which is designed to represent this general population, is 1,000 national adults.

>The actual number of people that need to be interviewed for a given sample is to some degree less important than the soundness of the fundamental equal probability of selection principle. In other words -- although this is something many people find hard to believe -- if respondents are not selected randomly, we could have a poll with a million people and still be significantly less likely to represent the views of all Americans than a much smaller sample of just 1,000 people -- if that sample is selected randomly.

Saya lebih respect sanggahan u/Affectionate\_Cat293 yang mengatakan kalau hasil survei tentang kepuasan di Indonesia harus disikapi secara kritis karena kecenderungan orang Indonesia ""membaik-baikkan"" keadaan ketika menjawab survei.

Selama kebanyakan orang Indonesia masih terlalu gampang terlena sama kharisma seorang figur dibandingkan pemikiran dan konsep, gue rasa hal2 kayak gini akan terulang terus.

>Mereka di sana buat kepentingan mereka dan partai mereka sendiri, bukan buat loe.

Salah satu pet peeve gue baca perpolitikan Indonesia tuh seringnya lihat orang setuju dengan ""dalam politik, tidak ada musuh atau teman abadi, yang ada kepentingan abadi"" dan orang2 kebanyakan anggep itu mantra yang seakan2 baku dan tidak bisa berubah. Padahal kalau menurut hemat ku, ini hanya trik narasi dari pemilik kepentingan saja yang mau membuat politik Indonesia selalu busuk, culas dan gak berprinsip.

Because in politics, IMO what really matters is the collective of the people and unifying principle behind them. Kalau prinsip masyarakat nya dibuat amat teramat bobrok dan semua hal hanya seputar mementingkan kepentingan masing2, mau sampai kapan juga negara ini gak akan berubah.

Case in point, Pancasila sebagai salah satu penopang prinsip negara sering disalahgunakan dengan over-emphasize sila pertama yang intinya hanya untuk kepentingan golongan.

Agama saja yang digadang2 jadi juru kunci penyelamat moral dan akhlak di negara ini sudah terbukti gagal segagal-gagalnya dalam menyelesaikan masalah sesederhana volume toa yang terlalu keras. Ngimpi kali bisa menyelesaikan masalah yang lebih besar kalau yang sesederhana ngecilin suara speaker aja udah belasan tahun ga beres2.

Sepertinya memang ada kesalahan fatal di fundamental nya mindset orang Indonesia secara umum yang bikin permasalahan apapun jadi berbelit2, entah itu sosial, agama, politik. Entah karena efek pendidikan buruk, propaganda negara yang terlalu berhasil, atau emang orang2 kita emang banyak yang bodoh aja."

Kalau berita nya cukup penting, biasanya bini gue juga lama2 senggol gue, dari situ gue baru cari tahu ada apa""

Jadi jaman sosmed begini emang rentan banget kita jadi terlalu kesedek sama berita 24/7. Dan kalau clean exit sosmed gak bisa, pakai tips ini aja.

Entah teori saya benar atau tidak, tapi PHK meningkat ≠ kehilangan pekerjaan meningkat.

https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/s/d0J6aOt53k

https://tradingeconomics.com/indonesia/unemployment-rate

https://tradingeconomics.com/indonesia/employed-persons

Kalau dari dua grafik di atas, unemployment trennya turun pasca COVID. Sementara, employed person cenderung naik.

Saya lihatnya PHK ""lebih terdata"". Singkatnya begini:

Pesangon = Pes., Uang Penghargaan Masa Kerja = UPMK, Uang Pengganti Hak = UPH.

UU lama mengatur kalau perusahaan mau efisiensi harus bayar 2×Pes + UPMK + UPH. Kalau pekerja berulah atau mengundurkan diri, hanya dibayar UPH karena satu salah pekerja satu lagi maunya pekerja. Terdengar masuk akal bukan?

Sayangnya, ini suka jadi celah perusahaan. Pekerja dipaksa mengundurkan diri supaya mereka hanya perlu bayar UPH.

Di peraturan baru, ada perubahan uang yang harus dibayar:

Efisiensi: 2×Pes + UPMK + UPH --> Pes (1/2 Pes kalau perusahaan rugi) + UPMK + UPH

Resign/pekerja berulah: UPH --> uang pisah (tergantung perusahaan, bisa UPMK) + UPH

Dan seterusnya. [https://www.hukumonline.com/klinik/a/hak-karyawan-phk-dan-resign-cl2066/](https://www.hukumonline.com/klinik/a/hak-karyawan-phk-dan-resign-cl2066/)

Saya tidak yakin tidak sampai 100.000 orang Indonesia yang kehilangan pekerjaan/putus kerja selama setahun. Dugaan saya, PHK hanya mencatat... yang PHK aja. Yang kontraknya selesai, yang mengundurkan diri, dsb tidak tercatat.

gue setuju kalau soal Tiktok. itu sosmed kebanyakan isinya bener2 ga ada faedahnya sama sekali. it's even worse than Twitter, wow, can't even believe I can say there is something worse than Twitter.

tapi kalau YouTube, lu masih bisa sebetulnya hard-curate your feed and recommendations so that it feels less awful. butuh waktu agak rajin buang2in yang gak penting, dan trik algoritme nya dengan follow (atau re-follow) channel2 yang lu suka aja, perlahan2 tapi pasti. totally achievable. Google still have a heart in the right places about this, algorithm actually helps you watch what you want with enough effort.

Just being angry alone won't change anything. You need to do something about that anger.

Hence why there's ""So what you could do? Does you can do something to prevent it with other people?"" part.

An individual is just a single drop of water, a community is a lake. So don't forget that ""To be able to change what within your ability is what we called strength/influence"" include changing others that you could reach, and community increase one reach.

Basically, if you think you can change within you reach and you have courage to do so, then do it."

If you think that our anger cannot make any difference, then you're totally wrong. You're oblivious on this one.

Over time, these stress hormones lead to increased inflammation throughout the body, resulting in significant health consequences.

But personally since living in LN, and traveled around few countries both Asia and Europe, my perspective about Indonesia actually got way worse lol. So I guess YMMV. Even with all the May 98 fiasco and anti-China hate, back in the day I still hold my judgement since I don't actually know what the hell is happening and still willing to learn the real root of the problem.

But yeah, at some level you're right tho. Lagian gue ga pernah bilang di luar negeri ga ada demagoguery dan irasionalitas. Indonesia isn't the worst place to be but it isn't the best either. Personally this country isn't my cup of tea, all things combined: its social, politics and especially its collective religion. I don't feel I belong here tbh.

Saat gue tinggal di luar negeri, one thing I love and miss is how citizens like me isn't wholly required to engage in hard politics and most people in the government seemingly know what they're doing at some level. Infrastructure is taken care of, public transportation is probably the best in Asia, bureaucracy isn't a nightmare, and problematic social issues are swiftly dealt with before it gets too big to handle. This I feel is a really big one: when the government is functioning, orang sipil kayak kita sebetulnya ga perlu2 amat ikutin politik begitu intense, karena kehidupan rutinitas lu tuh ga ""diganggu"" negara. You be a good citizen and your country is actually rewarding you by not bothering you, at all! Di Indonesia lu bener aja negara nyusahin lu, kalau susah boro2 ada di situ buat nolongin lu lol. Tapi sekalinya salah dikit aja dibully habis2an udah kayak lu kriminal.

Yah intinya. Jadi menurut gue pribadi yang bikin Indonesia unik adalah intensitas hal2 yang bikin quality of life menurun tuh banyak banget, ditambah lagi value dan prinsip kolektif negara ini sangat bentrok dengan gue pribadi, dan orang kayak gue (Cina) ternyata tidak terlalu disukai di negara ini. Not a big fan of Abrahamic mindset either. So yeah. Too little to relate to in general. Begitu banyak hal2 di negara ini yang gak sesuai dengan apa yang menurut gue bener.

I basically use r/Indonesia as a way to vent my frustration being stuck here lol. Since I thought, hey, I need to live here indefinitely anyway, might as well have a good laugh here and there not taking ourselves so seriously all the time while we still can."

More like this. Yang di-PHK meningkat, tapi orang yang kehilangan pekerjaan kan ada juga yang resign atau dipaksa resign, ada juga yang karena kontraknya habis jadi selesai pekerjaannya. Jadi tidak bisa langsung disimpulkan PHK naik ≠ kehilangan pekerjaan naik. Apalagi melihat data pengangguran dan employment yang mengatakan hal yang sebaliknya.

Saya berteori ""PHK lebih terdata"" karena teringat pesangon PHK sudah dipangkas khususnya buat efisiensi. Jelas sekarang yang dipaksa resign juga masih ada, tapi seharusnya tidak seburuk ketika pesangon masih tinggi banget."

The point is that, being emotional of everything won't change thing, you need to do something about it.

Now, you are angry, but do you are just angry and not doing anything? See? My point is not about invalidating the anger. You need to do something about the thing that make you angry. Voicing your anger is doing something. See the point?

Like, there is a large number of people who is angry about the PPN hike, but they aren't doing anything with their anger, not even making it known. 

Remember about ""to be able to change what within your ability is what we called strength/influence"" and about community part? I wonder what modern technology that can connect both of them? Does we have some kind of public platform where people can voicing their anger in the forum and agora and market and beerhall in the past, where even common people can increase the reach of their strength/influence? Exactly. In the past, you need to walk yourself and try to gather people who want to listen. Nowadays, those people is just one silicon chip and light diode away.

> memprotes

And there you have the answer. If you think you can change within you reach and you have courage to do so, then do it.

It’s nice to be able to hold them in my hands and carry them with me easily and I find small things especially cute. Also, it means that they don’t take up too much space."

I was on a mission to collect all the tiny bashful bunnies since. 

Then I started collecting tiny bashful animals. 

It got a bit expensive. But totally worth it. 

I’m a sucker for teeny cute widdle tings"
